This is based on the 'tree of Gernika', an ancient oak tree located in Gernika, below which since at least the 13th century the Lords of Biscay first, and afterwards their successors the Kings of Castile and the Kings of Spain solemnly swore to uphold the charter of Biscay, which secured widespread rights to the inhabitants of Biscay. Since the 14th century, the Juntas Generales (the parliament of Biscay) gathers in a building next to the oak tree, and symbolically passes its laws under the tree as well.

The pedunculate oak of the Croatian region of Slavonia (considered a separate subspecies - Slavonian Oak) is a regional symbol of Slavonia and a national symbol of Croatia. EnglandIn England, the English oak has assumed the status of a national emblem. This has its origins in the oak tree at Boscobel House, where the future King Charles II hid from his Parliamentarian pursuers in 1650 during the English Civil War; the tree has since been known as the Royal Oak. This event was celebrated nationally on 29 May as Oak Apple Day, which is continued to this day in some communities. \u2018The Royal Oak\u2019 is the third most popular pub name in Britain (541 in 2007) and has been the name of eight major Royal Navy warships. The naval associations are strengthened by the fact that oak was the main construction material for sailing warships. The Royal Navy was often described as \u2018The Wooden Walls of Old England\u2019 (a paraphrase of the Delphic Oracle) and the Navy\u2019s official quick march is \"Heart of Oak\". Furthermore, the oak is the most common woodland tree in England. An oak tree has been depicted on the reverse of the pound coin (the 1987 and 1992 issues) and a sprig of oak leaves and acorns is the emblem of the National Trust. GermanyIn Germany, the oak tree is used as a typical object and symbol in romanticism. It can be found in several paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and in \"Of the life of a Good-For-Nothing\" written by Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff as a symbol of the state protecting every man. In those works the oak is shown in different situations, with leaves and flowers or dead without any of its previous beauty. Those conditions are mostly symbols for the conditions Germany is in or going through. Furthermore, the oak's stem is a symbol for Germany's strength and stability. Oak branches were displayed on the reverse of the small coins of the old Deutsche Mark currency (1 through 10 Pfennigs; the 50 Pfennigs coin showed a woman planting an oak seedling), and are now also displayed on the reverse of the small German-issue Euro currency coins (1 through 5 cents).

Numerous insects live on the leaves, buds, and in the acorns. Q.robur supports the highest biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant (>400 spp). The acorns form a valuable food resource for several small mammals and some birds, notably Eurasian Jays Garrulus glandarius. Jays were overwhelmingly the primary propagators of oaks before humans began planting them commercially, because of their habit of taking acorns from the umbra of its parent tree and burying it undamaged elsewhere. Mammals, notably squirrels who tend to hoard acorns and other nuts most often leave them too abused to grow in the action of moving or storing them."}, {"description": "Quercus robur is a large deciduous tree, with circumference of grand oaks from 4 m to exceptional 12 m. The Majesty Oak with a circumference of 12.2 m is the thickest tree in Great Britain, and the Kaive Oak in Latvia with a circumference of 10.2 m is the thickest tree in Northern Europe. Q. robur has lobed and nearly sessile (very short-stalked) leaves 7 - long. Flowering takes place in mid spring, and their fruit, called acorns, ripen by the following autumn. The acorns are 2 - long, pedunculate (having a peduncle or acorn-stalk, 3 - long) with one to four acorns on each peduncle.It is a long-lived tree, with a large wide spreading crown of rugged branches. While it may naturally live to an age of a few centuries, many of the oldest trees are pollarded or coppiced, both pruning techniques that extend the tree's potential lifespan, if not its health. Two individuals of notable longevity are the Stelmu\u017e\u0117 Oak in Lithuania and the Granit Oak in Bulgaria, which are believed to be more than 1,500 years old, possibly making them the oldest oaks in Europe; another specimen, called the 'Kongeegen' ('Kings Oak'), estimated to be about 1,200 years old, grows in Jaegerspris, Denmark. Yet another can be found in Kvilleken, Sweden, that is over 1,000 years old and 14 m around. Of maiden (not pollarded) specimens, one of the oldest is the great oak of Ivenack, Germany. Tree-ring research of this tree and other oaks nearby gives an estimated age of 700 to 800 years old. Also the Bowthorpe Oak in Lincolnshire, England is estimated to be 1,000 years old, making it the oldest in the UK, although there is Knightwood Oak in the New Forest which is also said to be as old.

A number of cultivars are grown in gardens and parks and in arboreta and botanical gardens. The most common cultivar is Quercus robur 'Fastigiata', and is the exception among Q. robur cultivars which are generally smaller than the standard tree, growing to between 10\u201315 m and exhibit unusual leaf or crown shape characteristics. In Australia English Oak is one of the most common park trees in south-eastern Australia, noted for its vigorous, luxuriant growth. In Australia, it grows very quickly to a tree of 20 m tall by up to 20 m broad, with a low-branching canopy. Its trunk and secondary branches are very thick and solid and covered with deep-fissured blackish-grey bark. The largest example in Australia is in Donnybrook, Western Australia. Native Australian oaks are quite unrelated to the European oaks. Cultivars Quercus robur 'Fastigiata' (\"Cypress Oak\"), probably the most common cultivated form, it grows to a large imposing tree with a narrow columnar habit. The fastigiate oak was originally propagated from an upright tree that was found in central Europe. Quercus robur 'Concordia' (\"Golden Oak\"), a small very slow-growing tree, eventually reaching 10 m, with bright golden-yellow leaves throughout spring and summer. It was originally raised in Van Geert's nursery at Ghent in 1843. Quercus robur 'Pendula' (\"Weeping Oak\"), a small to medium sized tree with pendulous branches, reaching up to 15 m. Quercus robur 'Purpurea' is another cultivar growing to 10 m, but with purple coloured leaves. Quercus robur 'Filicifolia' (\"Cut-leaved Oak\") is a cultivar where the leaf is pinnately divided into fine forward pointing segments. HybridsAlong with the naturally occurring Q. \u00d7 rosacea, several hybrids with other white oak species have also been produced in cultivation, including Turner's Oak Q. \u00d7 turnerii, Heritage Oak Q. \u00d7 macdanielli, and Two Worlds Oak Q. \u00d7 bimundorum, the latter two developed by nurseries in the United States.

French agriculturist Olivier de Serres noted that transplanting mushroom mycelia would lead to more mushrooms.Originally, cultivation was unreliable as mushroom growers would watch for good flushes of mushrooms in fields before digging up the mycelium and replanting them in beds of composted manure or inoculating 'bricks' of compressed litter, loam, and manure. Spawn collected this way contained pathogens and crops commonly would be infected, or not grow at all. In 1893, sterilized, or pure culture, spawn was discovered and produced by the Pasteur Institute in Paris, for cultivation on composted horse manure. Today's commercial variety of the common mushroom originally was a light brown color.In 1926, a Pennsylvania mushroom farmer found a clump of common mushrooms with white caps in his mushroom bed. As with the reception of white bread, it was seen as a more attractive food item and became very popular. Similar to the commercial development history of the navel orange and Red Delicious apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1926 chance natural mutation.Agaricus bisporus is now cultivated in at least seventy countries throughout the world. Global production in the early 1990s was reported to be more than 1.5 million tons, worth more than US$ 2 billion."}, {"description": "The pileus or cap of the original wild species is a pale grey-brown in color, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the margins.

It is widely collected and eaten, even by those who would not normally experiment with mushroom hunting. Similar species The common mushroom could be confused with young specimens of the deadly poisonous destroying angel (Amanita sp.), but the latter may be distinguished by their volva or cup at the base of the mushroom and pure white gills (as opposed to pinkish or brown of Agaricus bisporus). Thus it is always important to clear away debris and examine the base of such similar mushrooms, as well as cutting open young specimens to check the gills. Furthermore, the destroying angel grows in mossy woods and lives symbiotically with spruce.A more common and less dangerous mistake is to confuse Agaricus bisporus with Agaricus xanthodermus, an inedible mushroom found worldwide in grassy areas. Agaricus xanthodermus has an odor reminiscent of phenol; its flesh turns yellow when bruised. This fungus causes nausea and vomiting in some people.The poisonous European species, Entoloma sinuatum, has a passing resemblance as well, but has yellowish gills turning pink and it lacks a ring."}, {"description": "Some 1990 studies have revealed that compounds in raw A. bisporus\u2014along with some other edible mushrooms\u2014contain hydrazine derivatives, including agaritine and gyromitrin, that have been evaluated for carcinogenic activity.

It was first described by English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his 1871 Handbook of British Fungi, as a variety (var. hortensis) of Agaricus campestris. Danish mycologist Jakob Emanuel Lange later reviewed a cultivar specimen, and dubbed it Psalliota hortensis var. bispora in 1926. In 1938, it was promoted to species status and renamed Psalliota bispora. Emil Imbach imparted the current scientific name of the species, Agaricus bisporus, after the genus Psalliota was renamed to Agaricus in 1946. The specific epithet bispora distinguishes the two-spored basidia from four-spored varieties.Among English speakers, Agaricus bisporus is known by many names. A young specimen with a closed cap and either pale white or light brown flesh is known as a button mushroom or white mushroom. In strains with darker flesh, the immature mushroom is variously marketed as a cremini mushroom, baby portobello, baby bella, mini bella, portabellini, Roman mushroom, Italian mushroom, or brown mushroom. At this stage of maturation, the cap also may begin to open slightly. In maturity, the mushroom is called a portobello.

When temperatures are above 15\u00a0\u00b0C (60\u00a0\u00b0F) they emerge from the soil and begin the mating and reproduction process. Burying beetles are unusual in that both the male and female take part in raising the young. Male burying beetles often locate carcasses first and then attract a mate. Beetles often fight over the carcass, with usually the largest male and female individuals winning. The victors bury the carcass, the pair mates, and the female lays her eggs in an adjacent tunnel. Within a few days, the larvae develop and both parents feed and tend their young, an unusual activity among insects, but a characteristic shared with the earwig. Brood size usually ranges from one to 30 young, but 12 to 15 is the average size.The larvae spend about a week feeding off the carcass then crawl into the soil to pupate, or develop.

Current information suggests that this species is a habitat generalist, or one that lives in many types of habitat, with a slight preference for grasslands and open understory oak hickory forests. However, the beetles are carrion specialists in that they need carrion the size of a dove or a chipmunk in order to reproduce. Carrion availability may be the greatest factor determining where the species can survive."}, {"description": "Historical records show that this beetle once lived in 35 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and three Canadian provinces: Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Now, natural populations are known to occur in only five states and at least one province: on Block Island in Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ontario. They have also been reintroduced to Ohio. N. americanus was listed as an endangered species in 1989; the IUCN lists the species as critically endangered. Biologists have not shown why N. americanus has disappeared from so many areas. Widespread use of pesticides may have caused local populations to disappear. The dramatic disappearance of this insect from many areas, however, took place before widespread use of DDT. Lack of small carcasses to bury would prevent the species from reproducing, and changes in land use has reduced the quantity of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals preferred by N. americanus. Even the extinction of the once ubiquitous passenger pigeon may have had a ripple effect on carrion feeders like this beetle.The immediate goal of conservation efforts is to reduce the threat of extinction by creating captive and wild populations.

They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor. They can also passively transport microbes on their body surfaces including those that are potentially dangerous to humans, particularly in environments such as hospitals. Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans. One of the proteins that triggers allergic reactions is tropomyosin. These allergens are also linked with asthma.General preventive measures against household pests include keeping all water and food stored away in sealed containers, using garbage cans with tight lids, frequent cleaning in the kitchen, and regular vacuuming. Any water leaks, such as dripping taps, should also be repaired. It is also helpful to seal off any entry points, such as holes around baseboards, between kitchen cabinets, pipes, doors, and windows with some steel wool or copper mesh and some cement, putty or silicone caulk.Diatomaceous earth applied as a fine powder works very well to eliminate cockroaches as long as it remains in place and dry.http://howtousediatomaceousearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/The-IPM-Practitioner.pdf Diatomaceous earth is harmless to humans and feels like talcum powder. Most insects, including bed bugs, are vulnerable to it.Some cockroaches have been known to live up to three months without food and a month without water. Frequently living outdoors, although preferring warm climates and considered \"cold intolerant\", they are resilient enough to survive occasional freezing temperatures. This makes them difficult to eradicate once they have infested an area.Of the numerous parasites and predators of cockroaches, few have proven to be highly effective for biological control of pest species. Wasps in the family Evaniidae are perhaps the most effective insect predators, as they attack the egg cases, and wasps in the family Ampulicidae are predators on adult and nymphal cockroaches (e.g., Ampulex compressa). The house centipede is probably the most effective control agent of cockroaches, though many homeowners find the centipedes themselves objectionable.Ampulex wasps sting the roach more than once and in a specific way. The first sting is directed at nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim for up to five minutes, more than enough time for the wasp to deliver a second sting. The second sting is directed into a region of the cockroach's brain that controls the escape reflex, among other things.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. When the cockroach has recovered from the first sting it makes no attempt to flee. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some of the hemolymph before walking backwards and dragging the roach by its clipped antennae to a burrow, where an egg will be laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.Bait stations, gels containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder are toxic to cockroaches. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Additionally, pest control products containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective.In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves as a cockroach repellent in their vehicles.Li J. and Ho S.H.

Proceedings of the 9th National Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (2003-09-13).An inexpensive roach trap can easily be made from a deep, smooth-walled jar with some roach food inside, placed with the top of the jar touching a wall or with sticks (outside the jar) leading up to the top so the roaches can reach the opening. Once inside they cannot climb back out. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a roach attractant) will ensure they drown. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.William Brodbeck Herms. Medical and Veterinary Entomology. The MacMillan company, 1915, p.\u00a044. A bit of Vaseline can be smeared on the inside of the jar to enhance slipperiness. The method is sometimes called the \"Vegas roach trap\" after it was popularized by a Las Vegas-based TV station.

The term cucaracha (sp. cuca \"bug\", and raxa \"streak\" (modern Spanish raya)) originally was used for the wood louse (the sow bug), but later was used to mean the palmetto bug (the flying cockroach). It is from this later Mexican usage that English-speaking Americans began using the term for regular (non-flying) cockroach.The scientific name derives from the Latinized Greek name for the insect (Doric Greek: \u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1, bl\u00e1tta; Ionic and Attic Greek: \u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b7, bl\u00e1tt\u0113)."}, {"description": "Cockroaches are generally rather large insects. Most species are about the size of a thumbnail, but several species are bigger. The world's heaviest cockroach is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach Macropanesthia rhinoceros, which can reach 9 cm in length and weigh more than 30 g. Comparable in size is the Central American giant cockroach Blaberus giganteus, which grows to a similar length but is not as heavy. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest cockroach species is Megaloblatta longipennis, which can reach 97 mm in length and 45 mm across. A Central and South American species, Megaloblatta blaberoides, has the largest wingspan of up to 185 mm.Cockroaches have broad, flattened bodies and relatively small heads. They are generalized insects, with few special adaptations, and may be among the most primitive living neopteran insects. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include generalised chewing mandibles. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible, antennae.The first pair of wings (the tegmina) are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins. The legs are sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. The abdomen has ten segments and several cerci. Eggs and egg capsules Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomens; the egg case of the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led many to claim the existence of albino cockroaches.A female German cockroach carries an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year. The female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce an extremely high number of eggs in a lifetime; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her life. SoundsAside from the famous hissing noise, some cockroaches (including a species in Florida) will make a chirping noise.CockRoach (Blattella Germanica). pest911.com Several Australian species practice acoustic and vibration behaviour as an aspect of courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, in the presence of a potential mate some cockroaches will tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. It is hypothesized that acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics. Digestive tractCockroaches are most common in tropical and subtropical climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen. Cockroaches are generally omnivorous; with the exception of the wood-eating species such as Cryptocercus, these roaches are incapable of digesting cellulose themselves, but have symbiotic relationships with various protozoans and bacteria that digest the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients.The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that they have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis of relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, and which recent genetic studies indicate are very primitive cockroaches.Cave may hold missing link. Theage.com.au (2007-03-21). Retrieved on 2012-04-29. Tracheae and breathingCockroaches, like all insects, breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae. The tracheae of insects are attached to the spiracles, excluding the head. Thus, cockroaches, like all insects, are not dependent on the mouth and windpipe to breathe. The valves open when the CO2 level in the insect rises to a high level; then the CO2 diffuses out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh O2 diffuses in. Unlike in vertebrates that depend on blood for transporting O2 and CO2, the tracheal system brings the air directly to cells, with the tracheal tubes branching continually like a tree until their finest divisions, tracheoles, are associated with each cell, allowing gaseous oxygen to dissolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole. CO2 diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole.While cockroaches do not have lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner, in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air out and in the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.The Cockroach FAQ bio.umass.edu ReproductionCockroaches use pheromones to attract mates, and the males practice courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.The female usually attaches the egg case to a substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or carries it about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their bodies, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.Cockroach nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take a few months to over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have been recorded as surviving for four years in the laboratory. Hardiness Cockroaches are among the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. In one experiment, cockroaches were able to recover from being submerged underwater for half an hour.MythBusters \u2013 Drowning Cockroaches?.

Japanese cockroach (P.\u00a0japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at -5\u00a0\u00b0C to -8\u00a0\u00b0C in laboratory experiments. Experiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained, including shock avoidance and escape behavior, although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation, and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research. The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients.It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will \"inherit the earth\" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps six to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly.The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable to the effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful."}, {"description": "Because of their long, persistent association with humans, cockroaches are frequently referred to in art, literature, folk tales and theater and film and real life. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as vile and dirty pests. Their size, long antennae, shiny appearance and spiny legs make them disgusting to many humans, sometimes even to the point of phobic responses. This is borne out in many depictions of cockroaches, from political versions of the song La Cucaracha where political opponents are compared to cockroaches, through the 1982 movie Creepshow and TV shows such as the X-Files, to the Hutu extremists' reference to the Tutsi minority as cockroaches during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994 and the controversial cartoons published in the \"Iran weekly magazine\" in 2006 which implied a comparison between Iranian Azeris and cockroaches. The second part of the Harry Hole crime novels written by Jo Nesb\u00f8 is called The Cockroaches (Kakerlakkene in Norwegian). In the movie Men in Black a giant alien cockroach is shown as a predator and criminal who eats a farmer and then uses his skin to disguise itself as a human being. In Oliver!, the children, Mr. Bumble, and Widow Corney sing about feeding Oliver cockroaches in a canister. Award-winning computer and video game series Fallout takes place in a postatomic bomb war universe, in which enlarged, irradiated cockroaches are present as early enemies. This is a nod to the notion of their nuclear fortitude. Also, in Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, a man, Gregor Samsa, is transformed overnight into a monstrous insect with cockroach-like features. He views himself as repulsive in his new identity, and is treated as a pest and burden by even his own family. Ayn Rand in her early novel \"We the Living\" compared the Soviet Union to a huge pile of cockroaches. During Australian Rugby League State of Origin matches, it is common slang to refer to Queensland as canetoads and New South Wales as cockroaches.Not all depictions of cockroaches are purely negative, however. Twilight of the Cockroaches depicts the extermination of cockroaches as a holocaust, and presents a happy ending as the pregnant lead cockroach, Naomi, escapes to mother many generations. In the Pixar film Wall-E, a cockroach that has survived all humanity is the best friend of the lead character (a robot), and waits patiently on him to return. The same cockroach survives getting squished twice. Milquetoast the Cockroach was a major character in the popular comic strip Bloom County and its sequel Outland. In the film Joe's Apartment, the cockroaches help the titular hero, and the narrator of the book Archy and Mehitabel is a sympathetic cockroach. In the book Revolt of the Cockroach People, an autobiographical novel by Oscar Zeta Acosta, cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 70s. The image of cockroaches as resilient also leads people to compare themselves to cockroaches. Donald Harington's satirical novel The Cockroaches of Stay More (Harcourt, 1989) imagines a community of \"roosterroaches\" in a mythical Ozark town where the insects are named after their human counterparts.

A peculiar exception is the Asian cockroach, which is attracted to light.The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of their locomotion on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.Cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces, as well as emitting airborne pheromones for swarming and mating. These chemical trails transmit bacteria onto surfaces. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.Daily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood. In 2005, the role of one of these proteins, pigment dispersing factor (PDF), was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the cockroach. Behavioral studiesResearch has shown group-based decision-making is responsible for complex behaviors such as resource allocation. In a study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty. When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter. Researchers found a balance between cooperation and competition exists in the group decision-making behavior found in cockroaches. The models used in this research can also explain the group dynamics of other insects and animals.Another study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so they would be accepted by the real roaches."}, {"description": "Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea, sometimes called Blattaria, of which about 30 species out of 4,600Beccaloni, G.

Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells (R1-8), support cells, pigment cells, and a cornea. Wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells, which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly isn't blinded by ambient light.Each photoreceptor cell consists of two main sections, the cell body and the rhabdomere. The cell body contains the nucleus while the 100-\u03bcm-long rhabdomere is made up of toothbrush-like stacks of membrane called microvilli. Each microvillus is 1\u20132 \u03bcm in length and ~60 nm in diameter. The membrane of the rhabdomere is packed with about 100 million rhodopsin molecules, the visual protein that absorbs light. The rest of the visual proteins are also tightly packed into the microvillar space, leaving little room for cytoplasm.The photoreceptors in Drosophila express a variety of rhodopsin isoforms. The R1-R6 photoreceptor cells express Rhodopsin1 (Rh1), which absorbs blue light (480\u00a0nm). The R7 and R8 cells express a combination of either Rh3 or Rh4, which absorb UV light (345\u00a0nm and 375\u00a0nm), and Rh5 or Rh6, which absorb blue (437\u00a0nm) and green (508\u00a0nm) light respectively. Each rhodopsin molecule consists of an opsin protein covalently linked to a carotenoid chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal.As in vertebrate vision, visual transduction in invertebrates occurs via a G protein-coupled pathway. However, in vertebrates the G protein is transducin, while the G protein in invertebrates is Gq (dgq in Drosophila). When rhodopsin (Rh) absorbs a photon of light its chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, is isomerized to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal. Rh undergoes a conformational change into its active form, metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin activates Gq, which in turn activates a phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2) known as NorpA.PLC\u03b2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid found in the cell membrane, into soluble inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stays in the cell membrane. DAG or a derivative of DAG causes a calcium selective ion channel known as TRP (transient receptor potential) to open and calcium and sodium flows into the cell. IP3 is thought to bind to IP3 receptors in the subrhabdomeric cisternae, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, and cause release of calcium, but this process doesn't seem to be essential for normal vision.Calcium binds to proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) and an eye-specific protein kinase C (PKC) known as InaC. These proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response. In addition, proteins called arrestins bind metarhodopsin and prevent it from activating more Gq. A sodium-calcium exchanger known as CalX pumps the calcium out of the cell. It uses the inward sodium gradient to export calcium at a stoichiometry of 3 Na+/ 1 Ca++.TRP, InaC, and PLC form a signaling complex by binding a scaffolding protein called InaD. InaD contains five binding domains called PDZ domain proteins, which specifically bind the C termini of target proteins. Disruption of the complex by mutations in either the PDZ domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling. For example, disruption of the interaction between InaC, the protein kinase C, and InaD results in a delay in inactivation of the light response.Unlike vertebrate metarhodopsin, invertebrate metarhodopsin can be converted back into rhodopsin by absorbing a photon of orange light (580\u00a0nm).Approximately two-thirds of the Drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing. Although the spatial resolution of their vision is significantly worse than that of humans, their temporal resolution is approximately ten times better."}, {"description": "Drosophila have both X and Y chromosomes as well as autosomes. Unlike humans, the Y chromosome does not confer maleness; rather, it encodes genes necessary for making sperm. Sex is instead determined by the ratio of autosomes to X chromosomes. Furthermore, each cell \"decides\" whether to be male or female independently of the rest of the organism resulting in the occasional occurrence of gynandromorphs. X Chromosomes Autosomes Ratio of X:A Sex XXXX AAAA 1 Normal Female XXX AAA 1 Normal Female XXY AA 1 Normal Female XXYY AA 1 Normal Female XX AA 1 Normal Female X AA 0.50 Normal Male (sterile) XXX AA 1.50 Metafemale XXXX AAA 1.33 Metafemale XX AAA 0.66 Intersex X AAA 0.33 Metamale Three major genes are involved in determination of Drosophila sex. These are Sex-lethal, Sisterless and Deadpan. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits sex-lethal while sisterless is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of deadpan. An AAX cell has twice as much deadpan as sisterless and so sex-lethal will be inhibited creating a male. On the other hand an AAXX cell will produce enough sisterless to inhibit the action of deadpan allowing the sex-lethal gene to be transcribed creating a female.Later control by deadpan and sisterless disappears and what becomes important is the form of the sex-lethal gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the cDNA has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. Sex-lethal has been shown to affect the splicing of its own mRNA. In males the 3rd exon is included which encodes a stop codon causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of sex-lethal causes this exon to be missed out the other 7 amino acids are produced as a full peptide chain, again giving us a difference between males and females.Presence or absence of functional Sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as Doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, Doublesex will have the 4th exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the 4th exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]). DSX-F causes transcription of Yolk proteins 1 and 2 in somatic cells which will be pumped into the oocyte on its production."}, {"description": "\"Inside the Fly Lab\" \u2014 broadcast by WGBH and PBS, in the program series \"Curious\", January 2008. \"How a Fly Detects Poison\" \u2014 WhyFiles.org article describes how the fruit fly tastes a larva-killing chemical in food."}, {"description": "Wildtype fruit flies are yellow-brown, with brick red eyes and transverse black rings across the abdomen.

There are extensive images at FlyBase."}, {"description": "Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology. There are several reasons: Its care and culture requires little equipment and uses little space even when using large cultures, and the overall cost is low. It is small and easy to grow in the laboratory and their morphology is easy to identify once they are anesthetized (usually with ether, carbon dioxide gas, by cooling them, or with products like FlyNap) It has a short generation time (about 10 days at room temperature) so several generations can be studied within a few weeks. It has a high fecundity (females lay up to 100 eggs per day, and perhaps 2000 in a lifetime). Males and females are readily distinguished and virgin females are easily isolated, facilitating genetic crossing. The mature larvae show giant chromosomes in the salivary glands called polytene chromosomes\u2014\"puffs\" indicate regions of transcription and hence gene activity. It has only four pairs of chromosomes: three autosomes, and one sex chromosome. Males do not show meiotic recombination, facilitating genetic studies. Recessive lethal \"balancer chromosomes\" carrying visible genetic markers can be used to keep stocks of lethal alleles in a heterozygous state without recombination due to multiple inversions in the balancer. Genetic transformation techniques have been available since 1987. Its complete genome was sequenced and first published in 2000. Genetic markersGenetic markers are commonly used in Drosophila research, for example within balancer chromosomes or P-element inserts, and most phenotypes are easily identifiable either with the naked eye or under a microscope. In the list of example common markers below, the allele symbol is followed by the name of the gene affected and a description of its phenotype. (Note: Recessive alleles are in lower case, while dominant alleles are capitalised.) Cy1: Curly; The wings curve away from the body, flight may be somewhat impaired. e1: ebony; Black body and wings (heterozygotes are also visibly darker than wild type). Sb1: stubble; Bristles are shorter and thicker than wild type. w1: white; Eyes lack pigmentation and appear white. y1: yellow; Body pigmentation and wings appear yellow. This is the fly analog of albinism. Drosophila genes are traditionally named after the phenotype they cause when mutated. For example, the absence of a particular gene in Drosophila will result in a mutant embryo that does not develop a heart. Scientists have thus called this gene tinman, named after the Oz character of the same name. This system of nomenclature results in a wider range of gene names than in other organisms."}, {"description": "The D. melanogaster lifespan is about 30 days at 29 C. It had been recorded that their lifespan can be increased to 3 months.http://rosemuellergreerlabs.com/portfolio/aging/gallery/research-interests/The developmental period for Drosophila melanogaster varies with temperature, as with many ectothermic species. The shortest development time (egg to adult), 7 days, is achieved at 28 C. Development times increase at higher temperatures (11 days at 30 C) due to heat stress. Under ideal conditions, the development time at 25 C is 8.5 days,Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University: Basic Methods of Culturing Drosophila at 18 C it takes 19 days and at 12 C it takes over 50 days. Under crowded conditions, development time increases, while the emerging flies are smaller. Females lay some 400 eggs (embryos), about five at a time, into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying mushrooms and sap fluxes. The eggs, which are about 0.5 millimetres long, hatch after 12\u201315 hours (at 25 C). The resulting larvae grow for about 4 days (at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) while molting twice (into 2nd- and 3rd-instar larvae), at about 24 and 48 h after hatching. During this time, they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit, as well as on the sugar of the fruit itself. Then the larvae encapsulate in the puparium and undergo a four-day-long metamorphosis (at 25\u00a0\u00b0C), after which the adults eclose (emerge). Females become receptive to courting males at about 8\u201312 hours after emergence. Specific neuron groups in females have been found to affect copulation behavior and mate choice. One such group in the abdominal nerve cord allows the female fly to pause her body movement in order to copulate. Activation of these neurons induces the female to cease movement and orient herself towards the male to allow for mounting. If the group is inactivated, the female remains in motion and does not copulate. Various chemical signals such as male pheromones often are able to activate the group.The female fruit fly prefers a shorter duration when it comes to sex. Males, on the other hand, prefer it to last longer. Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females. First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings. Soon after, the male positions itself at the rear of the female's abdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia. Finally, the male curls its abdomen, and attempts copulation. Females can reject males by moving away, kicking and extruding their ovipositor. Copulation lasts around 15\u201320 minutes, during which males transfer a few hundred very long (1.76\u00a0mm) sperm cells in seminal fluid to the female. Females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom-shaped spermathecae, sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization. A last male precedence is believed to exist in which the last male to mate with a female sires approximately 80% of her offspring. This precedence was found to occur through displacement and incapacitation. The displacement is attributed to sperm handling by the female fly as multiple matings are conducted and is most significant during the first 1\u20132 days after copulation. Displacement from the seminal receptacle is more significant than displacement from the spermathecae. Incapacitation of first male sperm by second male sperm becomes significant 2\u20137 days after copulation. The seminal fluid of the second male is believed to be responsible for this incapacitation mechanism (without removal of first male sperm) which takes effect before fertilization occurs. The delay in effectiveness of the incapacitation mechanism is believed to be a protective mechanism that prevents a male fly from incapacitating its own sperm should it mate with the same female fly repetitively. Sensory neurons in the uterus of female \"D. melanogaster\" respond to a male protein, sex peptide, which is found in sperm. This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination. The signal pathway leading to this change in behavior has been determined. The signal is sent to a brain region that is a homolog of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus then controls sexual behavior and desire D. melanogaster is often used for life extension studies. Beginning in 1980, Michael R. Rose conducted a groundbreaking study in experimental evolution resulting in \"Methuselah\" flies which had roughly double the lifespan of a wild-type fruit fly. More recently, particular genes such as the INDY gene have been identified which are purported to increase lifespan when mutated. Male sexual behavior and learning Behavior refers to the actions an organism might take in response to various internal or external inputs. Changes in behavior may indicate learning, which is when an organisms adapts to a situation or phenomenon by changing a particular behavioral response. Learning is usually associated with an increase in fitness, especially when the adapted behavior is an aspect of sexual behavior. D. melanogaster males exhibit a strong reproductive learning curve. That is, with sexual experience, these flies tend to modify their future mating behavior in multiple ways. These changes include increased selectivity for courting only intraspecifically, as well as decreased courtship times. Sexually na\u00efve D. melanogaster males are known to spend significant time courting interspecifically, such as with D. simulans flies. Na\u00efve D. melanogaster will also attempt to court females that are not yet sexually mature and other males. D. melanogaster males show little to no preference for D. melanogaster females over females of other species or even other male flies. However, after D. simulans or other flies incapable of copulation have rejected the males\u2019 advances, D. melanogaster are much less likely to spend time courting nonspecifically in the future. This apparent learned behavior modification seems to be evolutionarily significant, as it allows the males to avoid investing energy into hopeless sexual encounters. In addition, males with previous sexual experience will modify their courtship dance when attempting to mate with new females \u2013 the experienced males spend less time courting and therefore have lower mating latencies, meaning that they are able to reproduce more quickly. This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over na\u00efve males. This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages, as increased mating efficiency is extremely important in the eyes of natural selection."}, {"description": "Unlike mammals, Drosophila only have innate immunity and lack an adaptive immune response. The D. melanogaster immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the Toll and imd pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The Toll pathway in Drosophila is known as the homologue of Toll-Like pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the Toll pathway in flies, is produced in response to Gram-positive bacteria, parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the Toll receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerise for activation of downstream NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. On the other hand, the imd pathway is triggered by Gram-negative bacteria through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). D. melanogaster have a \"fat body\", which is thought to be homologous to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their cell walls. Years ago[when?] many drug companies wanted to purify these peptides and use them as antibiotics. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in drosophila, are known as the homologue of mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in immune responses. It is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear."}, {"description": "Drosophila melanogaster was among the first organisms used for genetic analysis, and today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best-known of all eukaryotic organisms. All organisms use common genetic systems; therefore, comprehending processes such as transcription and replication in fruit flies helps in understanding these processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.Charles W. Woodworth is credited with being the first to breed Drosophila in quantity and for suggesting to W. E. Castle that they might be used for genetic research during his time at Harvard University.Thomas Hunt Morgan began using fruit flies in experimental studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910. His laboratory was located on the top floor of Schermerhorn Hall, which became known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. The Fly Room was the source of some of the most important research in the history of biology. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including sex-linked inheritance, epistasis, multiple alleles, and gene mapping.\"Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues extended Mendel's work by describing X-linked inheritance and by showing that genes located on the same chromosome do not show independent assortment. Studies of X-linked traits helped confirm that genes are found on chromosomes, while studies of linked traits led to the first maps showing the locations of genetic loci on chromosomes\" (Freman 214). The first maps of Drosophila chromosomes were completed by Alfred Sturtevant."}, {"description": "The genome of D. melanogaster (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the FlyBase database) contains four pairs of chromosomes: an X/Y pair, and three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4.

The D. melanogaster sequenced genome of 139.5 million base pairs has been annotated and contains approximately 15,682 genes according to Ensemble release 73. More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA involved in gene expression control. Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the X:A ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, not because of the presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination. Although the Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic, it contains at least 16 genes, many of which are thought to have male-related functions. Similarity to humansAbout 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies, and 50% of fly protein sequences have mammalian homologs.

During these turns, a fly is able to rotate 90 degrees in less than 50 milliseconds.It was long thought that the characteristics of Drosophila flight were dominated by the viscosity of the air, rather than the inertia of the fly body. This view was challenged by research in the lab of Michael Dickinson, which indicated that flies perform banked turns, where the fly accelerates, slows down while turning, and accelerates again at the end of the turn, suggesting that inertia is the dominant force, as is the case with larger flying animals.Caltech Press Release 4/17/2003 However, subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible, the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies' turns to be damped viscously."}, {"description": "Embryogenesis in Drosophila has been extensively studied, as its small size, short generation time, and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies. It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a syncytium. During oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.After fertilization of the oocyte the early embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until approximately 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the 8th division most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed gastrulation starts.Nuclear division in the early Drosophila embryo happens so quickly there are no proper checkpoints so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their centrosomes and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.The gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the antero-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) axes (See under morphogenesis).The embryo undergoes well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a 1st-instar larva.During larval development, tissues known as imaginal discs grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a pupa, inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures."}, {"description": "In 1971, Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer published \"Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster\", a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal's behavior. Wild-type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency of about a day (24 hours). They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms as well as broken rhythms\u2014flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that comprise a biochemical or biological clock. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain.Since then, Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain and other processes, such as longevity.The first learning and memory mutants (dunce, rutabaga etc.) were isolated by William \"Chip\" Quinn while in Benzer's lab, and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic AMP, protein kinase A and a transcription factor known as CREB. These molecules were shown to be also involved in synaptic plasticity in Aplysia and mammals.Male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wing to generate sound, and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized. In particular, the fruitless gene has several different splice forms, and male flies expressing female splice forms have female-like behavior and vice-versa. The TRP channels nompC, nanchung, and inactive are expressed in sound sensitive Johnston's Organ neurons and participate in the transduction of sound.Furthermore, Drosophila has been used in neuropharmacological research, including studies of cocaine and alcohol consumption."}, {"description": "Drosophila is commonly considered a pest due to its tendency to infest habitations and establishments where fruit is found; the flies may collect in homes, restaurants, stores, and other locations.

There are a large number of fossil genera, but except those placed in Triassocoridae they can at least tentatively be assigned to the extant superfamilies.Though the systematics and phylogeny of the higher taxa of Nepomorpha were long controversial, cladistic analysis of mitochondrial 16S and nuclear 28S rDNA sequence data and morphology has more recently resolved to near-perfection. The long-accepted superfamilies are all monophyletic, with the exception of the Naucoroidea, which is now monotypic with the Aphelocheiridae and Potamocoridae being split off in a new superfamily Aphelocheiroidea. The Cibariopectinata, a proposed clade established on the presence of cibariopectine structures in the food-sucking pump of some of the most advanced true water bugs (Tripartita), might indeed be monophyletic.

Others are omnivores or feed on plants. Their mouthparts form a rostrum as in all Heteroptera and most Hemiptera. With this, they pierce their foodstuffs to suck out fluids; some, like the Corixidae, are also able to chew their food to some extent, sucking up the resulting pulp.

Today, Xanthosoma is still grown in all those regions, but is especially popular in Cuba and Puerto Rico, where it is used in alcapurrias or boiled. It is grown in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica to make the popular callaloo dish. It is also grown in West Africa, now a major producer, where it can be used as a replacement for yams in a popular regional dish called fufu. Xanthosoma is also grown as a crop in the Philippines.Traditionally, Xanthosoma has been a subsistence crop with excess sold at local markets, but in the United States, large numbers of Latin American immigrants have created a market for commercial production. In general, production has yet to meet demand in some areas. In Polynesia, Xanthosoma (\u2018ape) was considered a famine food, used only in the event of failure of the much preferred taro (kalo) crop.The typical Xanthosoma plant has a growing cycle of 9 to 11 months, during which time it produces a large stem called a corm, this surrounded by smaller edible cormels about the size of potatoes. These cormels (like the corm) are rich in starch. Their taste has been described as earthy and nutty, and they are a common ingredient in soups and stews. They may also be eaten grilled, fried, or pur\u00e9ed. The young, unfurled leaves of some varieties can be eaten as boiled leafy vegetables or used in soups and stews, such as the Caribbean callaloo. People with food allergies sometimes find malanga is a great hypoallergenic flour alternative, because the proteins are less allergenic.

When the inflorescence is ready to open, the upper part of the spathe opens and exposes the staminate area of the spadix; the basal area of the spathe remains closed, forming a spacious chamber (i.e., the spathe tube) that encloses the pistillate and sterile flowers ().The inflorescences last for two nights and are protogynous in some species (though not others (), changing from the pistillate phase that attracts pollinators on the night it opens, to a staminate phase on the second night, when pollen is shed. When the inflorescence opens, it produces heat and releases a sweet scent attracting its pollinators, dynastine beetles (Cyclocephala spp.). Dynastines arrive covered with pollen from another inflorescence and remain in the spathe tube for 24 hours, pollinating the pistillate flowers as they feed on the sterile area of the spadix. On the second night, they come out of the tube and walk over the staminate flowers, getting covered with pollen, and then flying to a recently opened inflorescence nearby. (). Fruit maturation takes several months. Fruits start to develop within the shelter of the spathe tube. When the infructescence is mature, in some species, it arches back and downwards.

Die Fr\u00fcchte werden bis vier Kilogramm schwer, sind zylindrisch, orangegelb und faserarm. Das Fruchtfleisch ist hellgelb und aromatisch. Um 2000 wurde die Smooth Cayenne durch die MD2 als kommerziell bedeutsamste Sorte abgel\u00f6st. Diese zeichnet sich durch eine h\u00f6here S\u00fc\u00dfe und geringe S\u00e4ure, sowie l\u00e4ngere Haltbarkeit von einem (ungek\u00fchlt) bis zwei (gek\u00fchlt) Monaten aus. Queen-Gruppe mit Natal Queen, Victoria, Alexandra, MacGregor, Z. Queen, Ripley Queen und Fairy Queen: Sie sind in Habitus und Frucht kleiner als Cayenne. Die Bl\u00e4tter sind schmal und kurz und haben gebogene Randstacheln. Die Fr\u00fcchte werden bis 1,3\u00a0kg schwer. Das Fruchtfleisch ist h\u00e4ufig kr\u00e4ftig gelb. Die Fr\u00fcchte sind aromatisch, s\u00fc\u00df, haben wenig Fasern und werden meist f\u00fcr den Frischverzehr angebaut. Spanish-Gruppe mit Singapore Spanish, Red Spanish: Die Bl\u00e4tter sind lang, schmal, meist stachlig. Die Fr\u00fcchte haben wei\u00dfes Fleisch, sind r\u00f6tlich-gelb, rund und recht faserreich bei bis zu 2,3\u00a0kg. Pernambuco-Gruppe mit Pernambuco, Sugar Loaf, Abacaxi, Paulista: Die Bl\u00e4tter sind lang und schmal mit kleinen, geraden Stacheln und einem breiten roten Streifen. Die Fr\u00fcchte sind pyramidenf\u00f6rmig, gr\u00fcngelb mit wei\u00dfem bis gelblichem Fleisch ohne Fasern. Sie werden besonders in Brasilien und Venezuela f\u00fcr den lokalen Verbrauch angebaut.

Sie w\u00e4chst terrestrisch, wurzelt also im Boden (w\u00e4hrend viele andere Arten der Bromeliaceae epiphytisch wachsen). Stamm Der keulenf\u00f6rmige Stamm der Ananas ist bis zu 35\u00a0cm lang und zu einem kleinen Teil im Boden eingesenkt. An der Basis hat er einen Durchmesser von 2\u20133,5\u00a0cm, an der dicksten Stelle, unterhalb der Spitze, jedoch 5\u20137\u00a0cm. Am ganzen Stamm sitzen dicht rosettenf\u00f6rmig die Laubbl\u00e4tter, meist etwa 70 bis 80. Die Bl\u00e4tter sitzen spiralig (in Links- oder Rechtsspiralen) am Stamm, die Phyllotaxis ist 5/13. Das hei\u00dft, nach f\u00fcnf Umdrehungen steht ein Blatt wieder exakt \u00fcber einem darunterliegenden, und dies ist das dreizehnte. Dies gilt zumindest f\u00fcr die Sorte \u2018Smooth Cayenne\u2019. Die Internodien sind mit 1\u201310\u00a0mm sehr kurz. Im L\u00e4ngsschnitt ist die Pflanze herzf\u00f6rmig.Der Stamm ist im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Monokotylen relativ deutlich in eine Rindenzone und einen Zentralzylinder (\u201eStele\u201c) mit den Gef\u00e4\u00dfb\u00fcndeln getrennt. Im Parenchym des Zentralzylinders eingestreut sind einzelne Idioblasten, die Raphiden-B\u00fcndel aus Kalziumoxalat in einem Schleimsack enthalten. Im Zentralzylinder ist keine Differenzierung in Knoten und Internodien erkennbar, in der Rinde sind die Zellen des Internodienbereichs langgestreckt, im Knotenbereich nicht. Bl\u00e4tterDie Bl\u00e4tter sind schmal lanzettlich, bis zu 120\u00a0cm lang und 3\u20137\u00a0cm breit. Die Blattscheide umschlie\u00dft den Stamm zu rund zwei Drittel. Die Blattr\u00e4nder sind nach oben gebogen, sodass der Blattquerschnitt halbmondf\u00f6rmig ist. Dies erh\u00f6ht die Biegungsfestigkeit des Blattes. Der Blattrand ist stachelartig scharf gez\u00e4hnt. Die Z\u00e4hne k\u00f6nnen bei manchen Sorten auch fehlen. Die Blattspitze ist dornig zugespitzt. Das Blatt ist relativ dick.Die Epidermis tr\u00e4gt an der Unterseite die Stomata und schildf\u00f6rmige Trichome. Diese sind kurz gestielt, sodass die Unterseite wei\u00dflich erscheint. An der Blattoberseite sitzen wesentlich weniger Trichome, sie konzentrieren sich hier auf die basalen Abschnitte. Die Epidermiszellen besitzen stark verdickte radiale und innere Zellw\u00e4nde, sind tot und von einem gro\u00dfen Silikat\u00adk\u00f6rper ausgef\u00fcllt. Unter der Epidermis befindet sich eine hypodermale Schicht aus stark verdickten, kollenchymatischen Zellen. An der Blattoberseite befindet sich ein Wasserspeichergewebe ohne Chlorophyll, das bis zur H\u00e4lfte des Blattquerschnitts einnehmen kann. Darunter befindet sich das Mesophyll. In diesem eingebettet sind: die Leitb\u00fcndel mit einer Kappe aus Sklerenchymfasern \u00fcber Xylem und Phloem; Faserstr\u00e4nge; L\u00fcftungskan\u00e4le aus sternf\u00f6rmigen Zellen. Die Leitb\u00fcndel sind von einer tannin\u00adhaltigen Parenchymscheide umgeben. Bl\u00fctenstand (Infloreszenz) einer Ananas comosus. Man sieht rote Hochbl\u00e4tter und die blauen Einzelbl\u00fcten. Aus dem Bl\u00fctenstand entsteht sp\u00e4ter die Ananas-Frucht. Samen einer Ananas Samen im Fruchtfleisch, links das Fruchtinnere, rechts die Schale der Frucht, Querschnitt Ananas-Frucht, L\u00e4ngsschnitt WurzelnDie Wurzeln sind Adventivwurzeln, die an den unteren Knoten des Stammes entspringen. Sie bilden ein dichtes Wurzelnetz, das rund einen Meter tief in den Boden eindringt und seitlich ein bis zwei Meter reicht. Die Wurzeln sind in der Regel mykorrhiziert. In den oberirdischen Blattachseln entwickeln sich ebenfalls Wurzeln, die bis zehn Zentimeter lang werden, und Wasser und N\u00e4hrstoffe aufnehmen, die sich in der Blattrosette ansammeln.Die Wurzeln besitzen eine polyarche Stele mit bis zu 30 Xylemstr\u00e4ngenB. H. Krauss: Anatomy III. 1949, S. 569. in den Wurzeln erster Ordnung. Bl\u00fcten- und Fruchtstand Aus dem Vegetationskegel des Stammes entwickelt sich jedes Jahr der 30\u00a0cm lange Bl\u00fctenstandsschaft. Am zapfenf\u00f6rmigen Bl\u00fctenstand sitzen \u00fcber 100 Einzelbl\u00fcten in acht Spiralen. Am oberen Ende befinden sich laubblattartige Hochbl\u00e4tter, die einen Schopf bilden. Bl\u00fcteDie unteren Teile der Bl\u00fcten sind mit ihrem Tragblatt und auch untereinander verwachsen. Die zwittrigen Bl\u00fcten sind dreiz\u00e4hlig, wie bei den Einkeimbl\u00e4ttrigen \u00fcblich: Die Bl\u00fctenh\u00fcllbl\u00e4tter sind unterschiedlich, die drei Kelchbl\u00e4tter sind unscheinbar, fleischig und k\u00fcrzer als die drei purpurn bis violett gef\u00e4rbten Kronbl\u00e4tter. Es gibt zwei Staubblatt\u00adkreise mit je drei Staubbl\u00e4ttern. Der Fruchtknoten ist unterst\u00e4ndig und hat drei F\u00e4cher. In jedem Fach sitzen 14 bis 20 meist anatrope Samenanlagen in zwei Reihen an der axill\u00e4ren Plazenta. Der Griffel ist dreinarbig. In den Septen zwischen den Fruchtbl\u00e4ttern sitzen drei Nektar-Dr\u00fcsen.Da die Kronbl\u00e4tter nur eine sehr kleine \u00d6ffnung freilassen, kann die Best\u00e4ubung nur durch sehr kleine Insekten erfolgen. In S\u00fcdamerika erfolgt sie auch durch manche Kolibriarten. Die \u00d6ffnung der Bl\u00fcten erfolgt im Bl\u00fctenstand von unten nach oben und erstreckt sich in Summe \u00fcber drei bis vier Wochen. Die Bl\u00fcten sind selbststeril. Die Fruchtbildung erfolgt jedoch auch ohne Befruchtung (Parthenokarpie), die Fr\u00fcchte haben dann keine Samen. Fruchtverb\u00e4nde mit Samen sind nicht f\u00fcr den Verzehr geeignet, da sie dann 2000 bis 3000 rauhe Samen mit hartem Endosperm bilden, die 3\u20135\u00a0mm lang sind und einen Durchmesser von 1\u20132\u00a0mm haben. Samen werden bei Kultursorten nicht gebildet, denn sie sind steril. Nach der Bl\u00fcte bleiben die Bl\u00fctenorgane erhalten, Griffel, Staubbl\u00e4tter, Bl\u00fctenbl\u00e4tter vertrocknen lediglich. FruchtverbandDie sogenannte Ananasfrucht setzt sich aus den Beeren-Fr\u00fcchten des ganzen Fruchtstandes sowie der Fruchtstandsachse und dem Blattschopf an der Spitze zusammen, ist also ein Fruchtverband. Sie ist zylindrisch bis kegelf\u00f6rmig. Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, Gestalt, Geschmack und Farbe sind je nach Sorte sehr unterschiedlich, die Farbe des Fruchtstandes reicht von gelblich bis br\u00e4unlich, die des Fruchtfleisches von wei\u00dflich bis tiefgelb.Im Inneren des Fruchtstandes befindet sich die verdickte, fleischige, aber auch faserige Bl\u00fctenstandsachse. Nach au\u00dfen folgt der gew\u00f6hnlich als Fruchtfleisch bezeichnete Teil, der aus den Beeren und den unteren Abschnitten der Tragbl\u00e4tter besteht, die alle verwachsen sind. Das \u00c4u\u00dfere des Fruchtstandes (\u201eRinde\u201c) besteht aus den Kelch- und Bl\u00fctenbl\u00e4ttern, dem obersten Teil der Fruchtknoten und den braunen, h\u00e4utigen Enden der Tragbl\u00e4tter. Inhaltsstoffe der Fr\u00fcchte Die Ananasfrucht ist reich an Vitaminen (besonders Vitamin C) und Mineralstoffen sowie an Enzymen (u.\u00a0a. Bromelain oder Bromelin, Invertase).Der N\u00e4hrwert f\u00fcr 100\u00a0g liegt bei 232 kJ, bzw. 56\u00a0kcal. Es sind 12,4\u00a0g Kohlenhydrate, 0,5\u00a0g Proteine, 0,2\u00a0g Fett und 84,7\u00a0g Wasser enthalten. Ananas enth\u00e4lt kein Cholesterin.

PhysiologieDie Ananas ist eine CAM-Pflanze: In Trockenperioden \u00f6ffnet sie ihre Spalt\u00f6ffnungen nur nachts und fixiert das Kohlendioxid in Form von S\u00e4uren. Bei Tag wird das Kohlendioxid bei geschlossenen Spalt\u00f6ffnungen wieder freigesetzt und steht somit der Photosynthese zur Verf\u00fcgung. Mit diesem Mechanismus wird der Wasserverlust durch Verdunstung minimiert. Sie ist eine der wenigen CAM-Pflanzen von kommerzieller Bedeutung."}, {"description": "Karl II.]] die erste in England gezogene Ananas. Gem\u00e4lde von Hendrik Danckerts, 1675 Die Ananas wurde bereits in pr\u00e4kolumbischer Zeit kultiviert und \u00fcber weite Teile S\u00fcdamerikas und im Norden bis nach Mexiko verbreitet. Sie wurde als Nahrungsmittel, Heilmittel und zur Weinherstellung genutzt. F\u00fcr Europa entdeckt wurde sie von Christoph Kolumbus am 4.\u00a0November 1493 bei seiner zweiten Reise auf Guadeloupe.

Britannica.com 1994\u20132002, ISBN 0-85229-797-1 Die erste Erw\u00e4hnung des Wortes Ananas stammt von Andr\u00e9 Thevet 1555.F\u00fcr eine weltweite Verbreitung sorgten besonders die Portugiesen, die die Ananas bereits kurz nach 1502 nach Sankt Helena brachten, und um 1550 nach Indien. Noch vor Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts wurde sie in den meisten tropischen Gebieten angebaut. Ab circa 1700 konnte die Ananas auch in Europa gezogen werden. Besonders im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert wurde die Ananas in England und Frankreich in Glash\u00e4usern gezogen. Von Frankreich aus wurde auch die Sorte \u2018Smooth Cayenne\u2019 in alle Welt verbreitet. Die geringe Haltbarkeit der Fr\u00fcchte setzte dem Handel lange Zeit enge Grenzen. Ab dem 19. Jahrhundert wurden die ganzen Pflanzen von der Karibik nach Europa verschifft, was die Preise sinken lie\u00df und den Glashausanbau zur\u00fcckgehen lie\u00df. Die Karibik etablierte sich als Lieferant f\u00fcr die USA, w\u00e4hrend Europa haupts\u00e4chlich von den Azoren beliefert wurde.Die Mechanisierung von Anbau und Ernte und die industrielle Verarbeitung begannen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts auf Hawaii, das rasch zum f\u00fchrenden Ananas-Anbaugebiet aufstieg. Im deutschen Sprachraum werden heute noch Ananasgerichte mit Hawaii assoziiert, etwa im Toast Hawaii oder Pizza Hawaii. Ab den 1950er Jahren wurde Hawaii zun\u00e4chst von den Philippinen, sp\u00e4ter auch Thailand als Hauptproduzent abgel\u00f6st.Rohrbach, Leal, Coppens d\u2019Eeckenbrock: History, Distribution and World Production.

In S\u00fcdafrika und Australien wird die Ananas noch bis 34\u00b0 s\u00fcdlicher Breite gepflanzt. In \u00c4quatorn\u00e4he werden die Plantagen auf bis zu 1500\u00a0m Seeh\u00f6he angelegt, in h\u00f6heren Breiten nur mehr bis 500\u00a0m. Das Temperaturoptimum liegt zwischen 24\u00a0\u00b0C und 30\u00a0\u00b0C, unterhalb von 20\u00a0\u00b0C reduziert sich das Wachstum deutlich. W\u00e4hrend der Fruchtreife k\u00f6nnen bereits Temperaturen unter 21\u00a0\u00b0C zu physiologischen St\u00f6rungen f\u00fchren, die sich in braunen Flecken in der Frucht \u00e4u\u00dfern.An Niederschl\u00e4gen sind mindestens 800\u2013900\u00a0mm pro Jahr erforderlich, das Optimum liegt zwischen 1000\u00a0mm und 1500\u00a0mm.Die Anspr\u00fcche der Ananas an den Boden sind eher gering. Sehr wichtig ist lediglich eine gute Wasserf\u00fchrung, da bereits kurze Perioden mit Staun\u00e4sse die Pflanzen irreversibel sch\u00e4digen. Am geeignetsten sind sandige B\u00f6den und Lehme. pH-Werte \u00fcber 5,5 k\u00f6nnen zu Calciumchlorosen f\u00fchren. Vermehrung und AnzuchtSch\u00f6sslinge, bei Negombo im Westen Sri Lankas Ananaspflanzen werden \u00fcberwiegend vegetativ vermehrt, was sehr leicht, meist \u00fcber Sch\u00f6sslinge erfolgt, wobei man je nach Entstehungsort an der Pflanze mehrere Sch\u00f6sslingsarten unterscheidet: F\u00fcr die Vermehrung am wichtigsten und besten geeignet sind diejenigen Sch\u00f6sslinge, die in den Blattachseln entstehen. Sie werden shoots genannt. Weniger geeignet, da sie l\u00e4nger zur Entwicklung brauchen, sind Sch\u00f6sslinge des unterirdischen Stammteils (suckers), Sch\u00f6sslinge der Fruchtstielbasis (hapas) und Sch\u00f6sslinge am Fruchtstiel direkt an der Fruchtbasis (slips). Auch die Kronen (crown) der Fr\u00fcchte k\u00f6nnen zur Vermehrung eingesetzt werden. Seltener werden aus dem entbl\u00e4tterten, manchmal auch geteilten Stamm Stecklinge gewonnen. In-vitro-Kulturen aus Sprossspitzen-Meristemen haben eine recht hohe Variabilit\u00e4t der so gewonnenen Pflanzen zur Folge.Die Vermehrung durch Samen ist un\u00fcblich, da zum einen die Aufzucht bis zur Fruchtbildung l\u00e4nger dauert, zum anderen die Merkmale aufgrund der Fremdbefruchtung nicht konstant sind. AnbaumethodenVeracruz]], Mexiko Reifende Frucht in Costa RicaDer Anbauzyklus dauert selten l\u00e4nger als vier Jahre. Nach dem Pflanzen betr\u00e4gt die Zeit bis zur ersten Ernte in den \u00c4quatorregionen 14 bis 16 Monate, in k\u00fchleren Gebieten 18 bis 20 Monate. Die zweite und dritte Ernte erfolgt dann in k\u00fcrzeren Intervallen, jedoch sinkt der Ertrag im Vergleich zur ersten Ernte kontinuierlich. Die zweite Ernte erbringt in k\u00fchleren Gebieten 60 bis 100 Prozent der ersten Ernte, in warmfeuchten Gebieten nur 40 Prozent.Die Bestandesdichten liegen bei Pflanzen f\u00fcr den Frischverbrauch bei 60.000 bis 70.000 Pflanzen pro Hektar, f\u00fcr Konservenfr\u00fcchte bei 40.000 bis 50.000.Zwischen zwei Anbauperioden werden Zwischenkulturen angebaut, h\u00e4ufig Gr\u00fcnd\u00fcngerpflanzen wie Vigna unguiculata, Crotalaria juncea und andere. Nahrungskulturen sind aufgrund der Residualwirkung von Herbiziden weniger geeignet.Ananas wird nicht nur in Monokultur angebaut. In Zwischenkulturen wird sie zusammen mit Pflanzen mit kurzem Wachstumszyklus angebaut, wie Erdnuss, Reis, Bohnen und Gem\u00fcse. Als Unterkultur wird die Ananas unter \u00d6lpalmen, Dattelpalmen, Zitrus-Arten, Avocado und Mango angepflanzt. D\u00fcngung und PflegeDer wichtigste Faktor f\u00fcr Ertrag, Fruchtfarbe und Zusammensetzung des Fruchtsaftes ist die Stickstoff-Versorgung. Auch die Kalium-Versorgung ist wichtig, w\u00e4hrend Phosphor weniger bedeutend ist. In den Best\u00e4nden muss der Boden st\u00e4ndig locker gehalten werden. Auch Unkr\u00e4uter m\u00fcssen entfernt werden, da die Ananas aufgrund ihrer Wuchsform leicht \u00fcberwuchert wird. Wichtige Unkr\u00e4uter sind das Nussgras (Cyperus rotundus) und Cynodon dactylon. Krankheiten und Sch\u00e4dlingeDie Verluste durch Krankheiten, Sch\u00e4dlinge und Unkr\u00e4uter belaufen sich auf rund 30 Prozent des potentiellen Ertrages.Am weitesten verbreitet ist die Ananaswelke. Ein Hauptverursacher ist die Ananasschmierlaus (Dysmicoccus brevipes), die haupts\u00e4chlich an den Wurzeln saugt und diese zum Absterben bringt. Dysmicoccus neobrevipes bef\u00e4llt haupts\u00e4chlich die oberirdischen Organe.http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/kbase/crop/Type/d_neobre.htm University of Hawaii Weitere Verursacher von Herz- und Wurzelf\u00e4ule sind au\u00dferdem Phytophthora cinnamomi, P. palmivora, P. nicotianae var. parasitica.Fruchtf\u00e4ulen treten zahlreich auf: Weichf\u00e4ulen (Ceratocystis paradoxa, Rhizopus stolonifer und Rhizopus oryzae), Trockenf\u00e4ule (Curvularia verruculosa, Penicillium claviforme, Aspergillus flavus), Rotf\u00e4ule (Pantoea agglomerans, Acetobacter aeceti), Marmorkrankheit (Erwinia ananas, Acetobacter peroxydans).nach Franke: Nutzpflanzen der Tropen, 1994.

Im Schnitt liegt der Ertrag bei der ersten Ernte bei bis zu 75 Tonnen pro Hektar, bei der zweiten Ernte bei 50, bei der dritten bei bis zu 35 Tonnen pro Hektar.Laut FAO wurden 2012 weltweit rund 23,3 Millionen Tonnen Ananasfr\u00fcchte produziert, wobei Thailand, Costa Rica, und Brasilien die drei gr\u00f6\u00dften Produzenten sind. Die USA mit ihrem Hauptanbaugebiet Hawaii, einst weltf\u00fchrend im Ananasanbau, liegen mit 180.500 Tonnen an Platz 24. Die Ananas ist nach Bananen und Zitrusfr\u00fcchten das wichtigste tropische Obst. Der Welthandel wird von Thailand und den Philippinen dominiert. Thailand ist unter den Exportl\u00e4ndern insofern eine Ausnahme, da Ananas hier haupts\u00e4chlich in kleinen Betrieben von ein bis f\u00fcnf Hektar Gr\u00f6\u00dfe angebaut wird."}, {"description": "Die Ananas (Ananas comosus respektive Ananas sativus) ist eine Pflanzenart aus der Familie der Bromeliengew\u00e4chse (Bromeliaceae).
