Thought to have originated in northern China, this rodent has now spread to all continents except Antarctica, and is the dominant rat in Europe and much of North America\u2014making it by at least this particular definition the most successful mammal on the planet after humans. With rare exceptions, the brown rat lives wherever humans live, particularly in urban areas.Selective breeding of Rattus norvegicus has produced the laboratory rat, a model organism in biological research, as well as pet rats."}, {"description": "The brown rat is nocturnal and is a good swimmer, both on the surface and underwater, and has been observed climbing slim round metal poles several feet in order to reach garden bird feeders. Brown rats dig well, and often excavate extensive burrow systems. A 2007 study found brown rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only found in humans and some primates, but further analysis suggested they may have been following simple operant conditioning principles. CommunicationBrown rats are capable of producing ultrasonic vocalizations. As pups, young rats use different types of ultrasonic cries to elicit and direct maternal search behavior, as well as to regulate their mother's movements in the nest. Although pups will produce ultrasounds around any other rats at 7 days old, by 14 days old they significantly reduce ultrasound production around male rats as a defensive response. Adult rats will emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to predators or perceived danger; the frequency and duration of such cries depends on the sex and reproductive status of the rat. The female rat will also emit ultrasonic vocalizations during mating. ChirpingRats may also emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic, socially induced vocalization during rough and tumble play, before receiving morphine, or mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct \"chirping\", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding.Science News 2001 Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is too high in pitch for humans to hear without special equipment. Bat detectors are often used by pet owners for this purpose.In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp appears to decline.Rat chirp also can be used for mosquito control.Other ultrasonic vocalizations, including a lower-frequency 'boom' or 'whoom' noise can be produced by bucks in a calm state, when grooming or settling down to sleep. Audible communicationBrown rats also produce communicative noises capable of being heard by humans. The most commonly heard in domestic rats is bruxing, or teeth-grinding, which is most usually triggered by happiness, but can also be 'self-comforting' in stressful situations, such as a visit to the vet. The noise is best described as either a quick clicking or 'burring' sound, varying from animal to animal.In addition, they commonly squeak along a range of tones from high, abrupt pain squeaks to soft, persistent 'singing' sounds during confrontations. DietThe brown rat is a true omnivore and will consume almost anything, but cereals form a substantial part of its diet. Martin Schein, founder of the Animal Behavior Society in 1964, studied the diet of brown rats and came to the conclusion that the most-liked foods of brown rats include scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and cooked corn kernels. According to Schein, the least-liked foods were raw beets, peaches, and raw celery.Foraging behavior is often population-specific, and varies by environment and food source. Brown rats living near a hatchery in West Virginia catch fingerling fish. Some colonies along the banks of the Po River in Italy will dive for mollusks, a practice demonstrating social learning among members of this species. Rats on the island of Norderoog in the North Sea stalk and kill sparrows and ducks. Reproduction and life cycleThe brown rat can breed throughout the year if conditions are suitable, with a female producing up to five litters a year. The gestation period is only 21 days, and litters can number up to 14, although seven is common. They reach sexual maturity in about five weeks. Under ideal conditions (for the rat), this means the population of females could increase by a factor of three and a half (half a litter of 7) in 8 weeks (5 weeks for sexual maturity and 3 weeks of gestation), corresponding to a population growing by a factor of 10 in just 15 weeks. The maximum life span is up to three years, although most barely manage one. A yearly mortality rate of 95% is estimated, with predators and interspecies conflict as major causes.When lactating, female rats display a 24-hour rhythm of maternal behavior, and will usually spend more time attending to smaller litters than large ones.Brown rats live in large, hierarchical groups, either in burrows or subsurface places, such as sewers and cellars. When food is in short supply, the rats lower in social order are the first to die. If a large fraction of a rat population is exterminated, the remaining rats will increase their reproductive rate, and quickly restore the old population level. Social behaviorRats commonly groom each other and sleep together.Social behavior of fancy rat As with dogs, rats create a social hierarchy, and each rat has its own place in the pack. Rats are said to establish an order of hierarchy, so one rat will be dominant over another one.Rats: Fancy Rat Behavior Groups of rats tend to \"play fight\", which can involve any combination of jumping, chasing, tumbling, and \"boxing\". Play fighting involves rats going for each other's necks, while serious fighting involves strikes at the others' back ends.Norway Rat Behavior Repertoire If living space become limited, rats may turn to aggressive behavior, which may result in the death of some animals, reducing the burden over the living space.Rats like most mammals also form family groups, a mother and her young.Barnett, S. (1975). The Rat: a study in behavior (pp. 52-115). Chicago, MI: The University of Chicago Press. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are territorial animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include, crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another,walking over, also explained in the name, then there is allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming. And lastly there is another type of contact called nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck. BurrowingRats are known to burrow extensively, both in the wild and in captivity, if given access to a suitable substrate. Rats generally begin a new burrow adjacent to an object or structure, as this provides a sturdy \"roof\" for the section of the burrow nearest to the ground's surface.Calhoun, J. B. (1962) Bethesda, MD: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Burrows usually develop to eventually include multiple levels of tunnels, as well as a secondary entrance. Older male rats will generally not burrow, while young males and females will burrow vigorously.Burrows provide rats with shelter and food storage, as well as safe, thermo-regulated nest sites. Rats use their burrows to escape from perceived threats in the surrounding environment; for example, rats will retreat to their burrows following a sudden, loud noise or while fleeing an intruder. Burrowing can therefore be described as a \"pre-encounter defensive behavior\", as opposed to a \"post-encounter defensive behavior\", such as flight, freezing, or avoidance of a threatening stimulus."}, {"description": "The fur is coarse and usually brown or dark grey, while the underparts are lighter grey or brown. The brown rat is a rather large true murid and can weigh twice as much as a black rat and many times more than a house mouse. The length is commonly in the range of 20 to, with the tail a further 18 to, thus being roughly the same length as the body. Adult body weight averages 350 g in males and about 250 g in females. Exceptionally large individuals can reportedly reach 900 to but are not expected outside of domestic specimens. Stories of rats attaining sizes as big as cats are exaggerations, or misidentifications of other rodents, such as the coypu and muskrat. In fact it is common for breeding wild brown rats to weigh (sometimes considerably) less than 300 g.Clark, B. R., & Price, E. O. (1981). Sexual maturation and fecundity of wild and domestic Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 63(1), 215-220.Leslie, P. H., Perry, J. S., Watson, J. S., & ELTON, C. (1946, February). The Determination of the Median Body\u2010Weight at which Female Rats reach Maturity. In Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (Vol. 115, No. 3\u20104, pp. 473-488). Blackwell Publishing Ltd.Brown rats have acute hearing, are sensitive to ultrasound, and possess a very highly developed olfactory sense. Their average heart rate is 300 to 400 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of around 100 per minute. The vision of a pigmented rat is poor, around 20/600, while a non-pigmented (albino) with no melanin in its eyes has both around 20/1200 vision and a terrible scattering of light within its vision. Brown rats are dichromates which perceive colors rather like a human with red-green colorblindness, and their colour saturation may be quite faint. Their blue perception, however, also has UV receptors, allowing them to see ultraviolet lights that some species cannot."}, {"description": "Similar to other rodents, brown rats may carry a number of pathogens, which can result in disease, including Weil's disease, rat bite fever, cryptosporidiosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the United Kingdom, brown rats are an important reservoir for Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever, with seroprevalence for the bacteria found to be as high as 53% in some wild populations.This species can also serve as a reservoir for Toxoplasma gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, though the disease usually spreads from rats to humans when domestic cats feed on infected brown rats. The parasite has a long history with the brown rat, and there are indications that the parasite has evolved to alter an infected rat's perception to cat predation, making it more susceptible to predation and increasing the likelihood of transmission.Surveys and specimens of brown rat populations throughout the world have shown this species is often associated with outbreaks of trichinosis,Samuel et al. (2001) Parasitic Diseases of Wild Mammals. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 380\u2013393. ISBN 0-8138-2978-X. but the extent to which the brown rat is responsible in transmitting Trichinella larvae to humans and other synanthropic animals is at least somewhat debatable. Trichinella pseudospiralis, a parasite previously not considered to be a potential pathogen in humans or domestic animals, has been found to be pathogenic in humans and carried by brown rats.Brown rats are sometimes mistakenly thought to be a major reservoir of bubonic plague, a possible cause of the Black Death. However, the bacterium responsible, Yersinia pestis, is commonly endemic in only a few rodent species and is usually transmitted zoonotically by rat fleas\u2014common carrier rodents today include ground squirrels and wood rats. However, brown rats may suffer from plague, as can many nonrodent species, including dogs, cats, and humans. The original carrier for the plague-infected fleas thought to be responsible for the Black Death was the black rat, and it has been hypothesized that the displacement of black rats by brown rats led to the decline of bubonic plague.See e.g., This theory has, however, been deprecated, as the dates of these displacements do not match the increases and decreases in plague outbreaks.See e.g.:"}, {"description": "Likely originating from the plains of Asia, northern China and Mongolia, the brown rat spread to other parts of the world sometime in the Middle Ages. The question of when brown rats became commensal with humans remains unsettled, but as a species, they have spread and established themselves along routes of human migration and now live almost everywhere humans are.The brown rat may have been present in Europe as early as 1553, a conclusion drawn from an illustration and description by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his book Historiae animalium, published 1551\u20131558.Freye, H.A., and Thenius, E. (1968) Die Nagetiere. Grzimeks Tierleben. (B. Grzimek, ed.) Volume 11. Kindler, Zurich. pp. 204\u2013211. Though Gesner's description could apply to the black rat, his mention of a large percentage of albino specimens\u2014not uncommon among wild populations of brown rats\u2014adds credibility to this conclusion.Suckow et al. (2006) The Laboratory Rat, 2nd ed. Academic Press. pp. 74. ISBN 0-12-074903-3. Reliable reports dating to the 18th century document the presence of the brown rat in Ireland in 1722, England in 1730, France in 1735, Germany in 1750, and Spain in 1800, becoming widespread during the Industrial Revolution. It did not reach North America until around 1750\u20131755.Nowak, Robert M. (1999) Walker's Mammals of the World. JHU Press. pp. 1521. ISBN 0-8018-5789-9.As it spread from Asia, the brown rat generally displaced the black rat in areas where humans lived. In addition to being larger and more aggressive, the change from wooden structures and thatched roofs to bricked and tiled buildings favored the burrowing brown rats over the arboreal black rats. In addition, brown rats eat a wider variety of foods, and are more resistant to weather extremes.Teisha Rowland. \"Ancient Origins of Pet Rats\", Santa Barbara Independent, 4 December 2009.In the absence of humans, brown rats prefer damp environments, such as river banks. However, the great majority are now linked to man-made environments, such as sewage systems. It is often said that there are as many rats in cities as people, but this varies from area to area depending on climate, living conditions, etc. Brown rats in cities tend not to wander extensively, often staying within 20 m of their nest if a suitable concentrated food supply is available, but they will range more widely where food availability is lower. There is great debate over the size of the population of rats in New York City, with estimates from almost 100 million rats to as few as 250,000. Experts suggest New York is a particularly attractive place for rats because of its aging infrastructure, high moisture, and high poverty rates. In addition to sewers, rats are very comfortable living in alleyways and residential buildings, as there is usually a large and continuous food source in those areas.In the United Kingdom, some figures show the rat population has been rising, with estimations that 81 million rats reside in the UK. Those figures would mean there are 1.3 rats per person in the country. High rat populations in the UK are often attributed to the mild climate, which allow them higher survival rates during the winter months.The only brown rat-free zones in the world are the Arctic, the Antarctic, some especially isolated islands, the province of Alberta in Canada, and certain conservation areas in New Zealand.[1]Perrow, Martin and A. J. Davy. (2002) Handbook of Ecological Restoration. Cambridge University Press. pp. 362\u2013363. ISBN 0-521-79128-6.Antarctica is almost completely covered by ice and has no permanent human inhabitants, making it uninhabitable by rats. The Arctic has extremely cold winters that rats cannot survive outdoors, and the human population density is extremely low, making it difficult for rats to travel from one habitation to another. When the occasional rat infestation is noticed and eliminated, the rats are unable to reinfest it from an adjacent one. Isolated islands are also able to eliminate rat populations because of low human population density and geographic distance from other rat populations. AlaskaRat Island in Alaska was infested with brown rats after a Japanese shipwreck in 1780. They had a devastating effect on the native bird life. An eradication program was started in 2007 and the island was declared rat free in June 2009. Alberta, CanadaAlberta, Canada, is the largest rat-free populated area in the world. Rat invasions of Alberta were stopped and eliminated by very aggressive government rat control measures, starting during the 1950s. The only species of Rattus which is capable of surviving the climate of Alberta is the brown rat, which can only survive in the prairie region of the province, and even then must overwinter in buildings. Although it is a major agricultural area, Alberta is far from any seaport and only a portion of its eastern boundary with Saskatchewan provides a favorable entry route for rats. Brown rats cannot survive in the wild boreal forest to the north, the Rocky Mountains to the west, nor can they safely cross the semiarid High Plains of Montana to the south. The first brown rat did not reach Alberta until 1950, and in 1951, the province launched a rat-control program that included shooting and poisoning rats, and bulldozing, burning down, and blowing up rat-infested buildings. The effort was backed by legislation that required every person and every municipality to destroy and prevent the establishment of designated pests. If they failed, the provincial government could carry out the necessary measures and charge the costs to the landowner or municipality.In the first year of the program, 64 t of arsenic trioxide were spread throughout 8,000 buildings on farms along the Saskatchewan border. In 1953, the much less toxic and more effective poison, warfarin, was introduced. By 1960, the number of rat infestations in Alberta dropped to below 200 per year. In 2002 the province finally recorded its first year with zero rat infestations, and from 2002 to 2007 there were only two infestations found. After an infestation of rats in the Medicine Hat landfill was found in 2012, the province's rat-free status was questioned. Provincial rat control specialists killed 147 rats in the landfill, and no live rats were found thereafter. In 2013 the number of rat infestations in Alberta dropped to zero again. Alberta defines an infestation as two or more rats found at the same location, since a single rat cannot reproduce. About a dozen single rats enter Alberta in an average year and are killed by provincial rat control specialists before they can reproduce. Only zoos, universities, and research institutes are allowed to keep caged rats in Alberta, and possession of unlicensed rats (including pet rats) by anyone else is punishable by a penalty of up to $5,000 or up to 60 days in jail. The adjacent and similarly landlocked province of Saskatchewan initiated a rat control program in 1972, and has managed to reduce the number of rats in the province substantially, although they have not been eliminated. The Saskatchewan rat control program has considerably reduced the number of rats trying to enter Alberta. New ZealandFirst arriving before 1800 (perhaps on James Cook's vessels), brown rats have posed a serious threat to many of New Zealand's native animals. Rat eradication programmes within New Zealand have led to rat-free zones on offshore islands and even on fenced \"ecological islands\" on the mainland. Before an eradication effort was launched in 2001, the sub-Antarctic Campbell Island had the highest population density of brown rats in the world."}, {"description": "Uses in science Selective breeding of albino brown rats rescued from being killed in a now-outlawed sport called rat baiting has produced the albino laboratory rat. Like mice, these rats are frequently subjects of medical, psychological and other biological experiments, and constitute an important model organism. This is because they grow quickly to sexual maturity and are easy to keep and to breed in captivity. When modern biologists refer to \"rats\", they almost always mean Rattus norvegicus. As pets The brown rat is kept as a pet in many parts of the world. Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are just a few of the countries that have formed fancy rat associations similar in nature to the American Kennel Club, establishing standards, orchestrating events, and promoting responsible pet ownership.The many different types of domesticated brown rats include variations in coat patterns, as well as the style of the coat, such as Hairless or Rex, and more recently developed variations in body size and structure, including dwarf and tailless fancy rats."}, {"description": "Originally called the \"Hanover rat\" by people wishing to link problems in 18th century England with the House of Hanover,Donaldson, Henry Herbert. (1915) The Rat. pp. 13. it is not known for certain why the brown rat is named Rattus norvegicus (Norwegian rat), as it did not originate from Norway. However, the English naturalist John Berkenhout, author of the 1769 book Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain, is most likely responsible for popularizing the misnomer. Berkenhout gave the brown rat the binomial name Rattus norvegicus, believing it had migrated to England from Norwegian ships in 1728, although no brown rat had entered Norway at that time.By the early to middle part of the 19th century, British academics were aware that the brown rat was not native to Norway, hypothesizing (incorrectly) that it may have come from Ireland, Gibraltar or across the English Channel with William the Conqueror.Friends' Intelligencer. (1858) Volume 14. William W. Moore, publisher. pp. 398. As early as 1850, however, a more correct understanding of the rat's origins was beginning to develop.Chambers, William and Robert Chambers. (1850) Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. pp. 132. The British novelist Charles Dickens acknowledged the misnomer in his weekly journal, All the Year Round, writing: \"Now there is a mystery about the native country of the best known species of rat, the common brown rat. It is frequently called, in books and otherwise, the 'Norway rat', and it is said to have been imported into this country in a ship-load of timber from Norway. Against this hypothesis stands the fact that when the brown rat had become common in this country, it was unknown in Norway, although there was a small animal like a rat, but really a lemming, which made its home there.\"Dickens, Charles. (1888) All the Year Round. New Series. Volume XLII, Number 1018. pp. 517. Academics began to understand the origins and corrected etymology of the brown rat towards the end of the 19th century, as seen in the 1895 text Natural History by American scholar Alfred Henry Miles: \"The brown rat is the species common in England, and best known throughout the world. It is said to have travelled from Persia to England less than two hundred years ago and to have spread from thence to other countries visited by English ships.\"Miles, Alfred Henry. (1895) Natural History. Dodd, Mead & Company. pp. 227 Though the assumptions surrounding this species' origins were not yet entirely accurate, by the 20th century, it was established among naturalists that the brown rat did not originate in Norway, rather the species came from central Asia and (likely) China.Cornish, Charles John.

Die Fortbewegung erfolgt jedoch \u00fcberwiegend auf etablierten Wegen auf dem Boden, in Geb\u00e4uden meist entlang von W\u00e4nden, zu denen die Tiere seitlich mit den Vibrissen Kontakt halten. In felsigen Gebieten laufen Wanderratten meist am Boden von Felsspalten.Wenn m\u00f6glich, legen Wanderratten Erdbaue an, die mindestens zwei Eing\u00e4nge und einen Wohnkessel sowie h\u00e4ufig auch Vorratskammern aufweisen. Die Eing\u00e4nge sind immer offen, die Hauptg\u00e4nge sind queroval, 8\u20139\u00a0cm hoch und 11\u201312\u00a0cm breit. In Geb\u00e4uden werden die Nester in Verstecken jeder Art gebaut, z. B. zwischen Warenstapeln, in Doppelw\u00e4nden, unter Fu\u00dfbodendielen oder unter Strohhaufen. Die Nester bestehen aus Gras, Bl\u00e4ttern, Papier und \u00e4hnlichem weichen Material. SozialverhaltenDie soziale Organisation einer \u00f6rtlichen Population ist vor allem vom Nahrungsangebot abh\u00e4ngig. In Habitaten mit einem geringen oder weit verteilten Nahrungsangebot besetzen einzelne M\u00e4nnchen Reviere, die wiederum die Reviere mehrerer Weibchen umfassen. In Bereichen mit einem hohen und an wenigen Stellen konzentrierten Nahrungsangebot, beispielsweise an M\u00fcllkippen, leben Wanderratten in Gruppen aus vielen Weibchen und vielen M\u00e4nnchen (\u201eClans\u201c), die ihr Territorium vermutlich gegen andere Clans verteidigen. Innerhalb eines Clans bilden die M\u00e4nnchen eine ann\u00e4hernd lineare Hierarchie aus, die durch h\u00e4ufige K\u00e4mpfe etabliert wird. Der soziale Status eines M\u00e4nnchens ist in erster Linie von dessen Alter abh\u00e4ngig. Zwar haben gr\u00f6\u00dfere M\u00e4nnchen gute Chancen, einen Kampf gegen kleinere M\u00e4nnchen zu gewinnen, vor allem, wenn diese fremd sind. Die einmal gegen\u00fcber einem bestimmten M\u00e4nnchen etablierte Position bleibt meist jedoch auch sp\u00e4ter erhalten, obwohl niedriger stehende M\u00e4nnchen den jeweils h\u00f6her positionierten dann k\u00f6rperlich ebenb\u00fcrtig oder sogar \u00fcberlegen sein k\u00f6nnen. In stabilen Clans ist Alter daher ein besserer Indikator f\u00fcr den sozialen Status eines M\u00e4nnchens als Gr\u00f6\u00dfe.David W.

Die Weibchen sind meist nur eine Nacht lang \u00f6strisch (empf\u00e4ngnisbereit). In dieser Zeit folgen ihnen ununterbrochen mehrere M\u00e4nnchen, meist zwei bis drei, maximal bis zu sieben. Die M\u00e4nnchen versuchen st\u00e4ndig, mit dem Weibchen zu kopulieren und dabei andere M\u00e4nnchen zu Seite zu dr\u00e4ngen. Dieser \u201eDr\u00e4ngelwettbewerb\u201c (engl. scramble competition) ist so intensiv, dass die M\u00e4nnchen dabei auf K\u00e4mpfe untereinander weitgehend verzichten, daher gelingt es auch in der Rangordnung niedrig stehenden M\u00e4nnchen, mit dem Weibchen zu kopulieren.David W. Macdonald, Fiona Mathews und Manuel Berdoy: The Behaviour and Ecology of Rattus norvegicus: from Opportunism to Kamikaze Tendencies. In: G. Singleton, L. Hinds, H. Leirs, Z. Zhang (Eds): Ecologically-based rodent management.

Auch diese Weibchen waren jedoch noch promisk und kopulierten auch mit einer Auswahl weiterer M\u00e4nnchen, jedoch in geringerem Ma\u00dfe als unter normalen Bedingungen. Die Fortpflanzung findet in Europa ganzj\u00e4hrig statt, in Berlin wurden Maxima im M\u00e4rz sowie im September und Oktober festgestellt, in England im Mai und im Oktober. Die Tragzeit betr\u00e4gt 22\u201324 Tage. Die W\u00fcrfe umfassten bei gez\u00fcchteten Wanderratten 1\u201315, meist 4\u20138 Junge. In Kleinst\u00e4dten Niedersachsens wurden bei in der Kanalisation lebenden Weibchen im Mittel fast 5, bei oberirdisch lebenden hingegen im Mittel fast 7 Embryonen gefunden. Wanderratten sind bei der Geburt nackt, Augen und Ohren sind geschlossen. Die Ohren \u00f6ffnen sich nach drei Tagen, der Haarwuchs beginnt nach 10 Tagen, und die Augen \u00f6ffnen sich im Alter von etwa 15 Tagen. Nach etwa 20 Tagen erkunden die Jungtiere die Nestumgebung und nach 25-30 Tagen auch die Umgebung des Baues. Sie werden etwa 40 Tage lang ges\u00e4ugt. Die Geschlechtsreife wird im Alter von drei bis vier Monaten erreicht.

Bei der gro\u00dfen Pest-Pandemie des ausgehenden Mittelalters spielte die Wanderratte zumindest in Europa keine gro\u00dfe Rolle, zu dieser Zeit kam sie in Europa nicht vor. Sie wird hingegen zusammen mit der Hausratte als Hauptreservoir der von China Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts ausgehenden Pest-Pandemie angesehen, der weltweit etwa 12 Millionen Menschen zum Opfer fielen, vor allem in Indien. Heute gelten die beiden Rattenarten nur noch in wenigen Regionen der Erde als wichtiges Reservoir des Pesterregers, hierzu z\u00e4hlen Madagaskar, Indien und die Demokratische Republik Kongo.Sarah E.

Online, abgerufen am 22. Februar 2011 Insgesamt war bzw. ist der negative Einfluss aber wohl deutlich geringer als bei der gleichfalls weltweit eingeb\u00fcrgerten Hausratte, unter anderem weil sich die Wanderratte vor allem in den Tropen deutlich schlechter etablieren konnte und hier vielfach an menschliche Siedlungen und / oder an offenes S\u00fc\u00dfwasser gebunden ist. Massive Auswirkungen sind vor allem f\u00fcr urspr\u00fcnglich s\u00e4ugerfreie kleine Inseln in gem\u00e4\u00dfigten und arktischen Klimaten dokumentiert, insbesondere um Neuseeland.

Its common name refers to its discoverer, Thai zoologist Kitti Thonglongya. Thonglongya worked with a British partner, John E.

While the Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected.Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma, at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct.

However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.Currently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Burmese population are not well known.In 2007, Kitti's hog-nosed bat was identified by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) project as one of its Top 10 \"focal species\"."}, {"description": "Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills, far from the entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures.Hutson, A. M., Mickleburgh, S. P. and Racey, P. A. (Compilers). 2001. Microchiropteran Bats: Global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN/SSC Chiroptera Specialist Group. IUCN: Gland, Switzerland. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.Late in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples."}, {"description": "Kitti's hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), also known as the bumblebee bat, is a vulnerable species of bat and the only extant member of the family Craseonycteridae.

It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.Although the bat's status in Burma is not well known, the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction.

They are still, however, agile climbers. They construct two types of homes called \"dreys\", depending on the season. Summer dreys are often little more than platforms of sticks high in the branches of trees, while winter dens are usually hollowed out of tree trunks by a succession of occupants over as many as 30 years. Cohabitation of these dens is not uncommon, particularly among breeding pairs.They are not particularly gregarious or playful, in fact they have been described as solitary and asocial creatures, coming together only in breeding season. They have a large vocabulary, consisting most notably of an assortment of clucking and chucking sounds, not unlike some \"game\" birds, and they warn the listening world of approaching threats with distress screams. In the spring and fall, groups of fox squirrels clucking and chucking together can make a small ruckus. They also make high-pitched whines during mating. When threatening another fox squirrel, they will stand upright with their tail over their back and flick it.They are impressive jumpers, easily spanning fifteen feet in horizontal leaps and free-falling twenty feet or more to a soft landing on a limb or trunk."}, {"description": "The squirrel's total body length measures 45 to, tail length is 20 to, and they range in weight from 500 to. There is no sexual dimorphism in size or appearance. Individuals tend to be smaller in the west. There are three distinct geographical phases in coloration: In most areas the animals upper body is brown-grey to brown-yellow with a typically brownish-orange underside, while in eastern regions such as the Appalachians there are more strikingly-patterned dark brown and black squirrels with white bands on the face and tail. In the south can be found isolated communities with uniform black coats. To help with climbing, they have sharp claws, developed extensors of digits and flexors of forearms, and abdominal musculature. Fox squirrels have excellent vision and well-developed senses of hearing and smell. They use scent marking to communicate with other fox squirrels. \"Fox squirrels also have several sets of vibrissae, thick hairs or whiskers that are used as touch receptors to sense the environment. These are found above and below their eyes, on their chin and nose, and on each forearm.\""}, {"description": "The fox squirrel's natural range extends throughout the eastern United States, north into the southern prairie provinces of Canada, and west to the Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas. They are absent (although sometimes vagrants) from New England, New Jersey, most of New York, as well as Northern and eastern Pennsylvania. They have been introduced to both northern and southern California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and New Mexico. While very versatile in their habitat choices, fox squirrels are most often found in forest patches of 40 hectares or less with an open understory, or in urban neighborhoods with trees. They thrive best among trees such as oak, hickory, walnut, and pine that produce winter-storable foods like nuts. Western range extensions in Great Plains regions such as Kansas are associated with riverine corridors of cottonwood. A subspecies native to several eastern US states is the Delmarva fox squirrel (S. n. cinereus).Van Gelden, Richard George. 1982. Mammals of the National Parks. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press"}, {"description": "Food habits of eastern fox squirrels depend largely on geographic location.Chapman, Joseph A.; Feldhamer, George A., eds. 1982. Wild mammals of North America. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Pres In general, eastern fox squirrel foods include mast, tree buds, insects, tubers, bulbs, roots, bird eggs, seeds of pines and spring-fruiting trees, and fungi. Agricultural crops such as corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and fruit are also eaten. Mast eaten by eastern fox squirrels commonly includes turkey oak (Quercus laevis), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and live oak (Quercus virginiana).In Illinois, eastern fox squirrels rely heavily on hickories from late August through September. Pecans, black walnuts (Juglans nigra), osage orange (Maclura pomifera) fruits, and corn are also important fall foods. In early spring, elm buds and seeds are the most important food. In May and June, mulberries (Morus spp.) are heavily used. By early summer, corn in the milk stage becomes a primary food.During the winter in Kansas, osage orange is a staple item supplemented with seeds of the Kentucky coffee tree (Gymnocladus dioicus) and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), corn, wheat, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. deltoides) bark, ash seeds, and eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) berries. In the spring, eastern fox squirrels feed primarily on buds of elm, maple, and oaks but also on newly sprouting leaves and insect larvae.Eastern fox squirrels in Ohio prefer hickory nuts, acorns, corn, and black walnuts. The squirrels are absent where two or more of these mast trees are missing. Eastern fox squirrels also eat buckeyes, seeds and buds of maple and elm, hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), and tree bark. In March, they feed mainly on buds and seeds of elm, maple, and willow. In Ohio, eastern fox squirrels have the following order of food preference: white oak (Quercus alba) acorns, black oak (Quercus velutina) acorns, red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns, walnuts, and corn.In eastern Texas, eastern fox squirrels prefer the acorns of bluejack oak, southern red oak (Q. falcata), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). The least preferred foods are acorns of swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii) and overcup oak. In California, eastern fox squirrels feed on English walnuts (J. regia), oranges, avocados, strawberries, and tomatoes. In midwinter, they feed on eucalyptus seeds.In Michigan, eastern fox squirrels feed on a variety of foods throughout the year. Spring foods are mainly tree buds and flowers, insects, bird eggs, and seeds of red maple (Acer rubrum), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and elms. Summer foods include a variety of berries, plum and cherry pits, fruits of basswood (Tilia americana), fruits of box elder (Acer negundo), black oak acorns, hickory nuts, seeds of sugar (Acer saccharum) and black maple (Acer nigrum), grains, insects, and unripe corn. Fall foods consist mainly of acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts, walnuts, butternuts (Juglans cinerea), and hazelnuts. Caches of acorns and hickory nuts are heavily used in winter."}, {"description": "Eastern fox squirrels are most abundant in open forest stands with little understory vegetation; they are not found in stands with dense undergrowth. Ideal habitat is small stands of large trees interspersed with agricultural land. The size and spacing of pines and oaks are among the important features of eastern fox squirrel habitat. The actual species of pines and oaks themselves may not always be a major consideration in defining eastern fox squirrel habitat. Eastern fox squirrels are often observed foraging on the ground several hundred meters from the nearest woodlot. Eastern fox squirrels also commonly occupy forest edge habitat.Dueser, Raymond D.; Dooley, James L., Jr.; Taylor, Gary J. 1988.

Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station: 414\u2013421Eastern fox squirrels have two types of shelters: leaf nests and tree dens. They may have two tree cavity homes or a tree cavity and a leaf nest. Tree dens are preferred over leaf nests during the winter and for raising young. When den trees are scarce, leaf nests are used year-round.Banfield, A. W. F. 1974. The mammals of Canada. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto PressMacClintock, Dorcas. 1970. Squirrels of North America. New York: Litton Educational Publishing, Inc. Leaf nests are built during the summer months in forks of deciduous trees about 30 feet (9 m) above the ground. Eastern fox squirrels use natural cavities and crotches (forked branches of a tree) as tree dens. Den trees in Ohio had an average diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of 21\u00a0inches (53\u00a0cm) and were an average of 58.6 yards (52.7 m) from the nearest woodland border. About 88% of den trees in eastern Texas had an average d.b.h. of 12\u00a0inches (30\u00a0cm) or more. Dens are usually 6\u00a0inches (15\u00a0cm) wide and 14 to 16 (35\u201341\u00a0cm) inches deep. Den openings are generally circular and about 2.9 to 3.7\u00a0inches (7.3\u20139.4\u00a0cm). Eastern fox squirrels may make their own den in a hollow tree by cutting through the interior; however, they generally use natural cavities or cavities created by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) or red-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus). Crow nests have also been used by eastern fox squirrels.Eastern fox squirrels use leaf nests or tree cavities for shelter and litter rearing. Forest stands dominated by mature to over mature trees provide cavities and a sufficient number of sites for leaf nests to meet the cover requirements. Overstory trees with an average d.b.h. of 15\u00a0inches (38\u00a0cm) or more generally provide adequate cover and reproductive habitat. Optimum tree canopy closure for eastern fox squirrels is from 20% to 60%. Optimum conditions understory closure occur when the shrub-crown closure is 30% or less.Allen, A. W. 1982.

Their maximum life expectancy is typically 12.6 years for females and 8.6 years for males. Because of overhunting and the destruction of mature forests, many subspecies of fox squirrel (the Delmarva fox squirrel for example) are endangered. Another major cause of fox squirrel population decline is mange mite (Cnemidoptes sp.) along with severe winter weather.Relatively few natural predators can regularly capture adult eastern fox squirrels. Of these predators, most only take eastern fox squirrels opportunistically. Eastern fox squirrel predators include: bobcats (Felis rufus), foxes (Vulpes spp. and Urocyon spp.), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), barred owls (Strix varia), and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Nestlings and young eastern fox squirrels are particularly vulnerable to climbing predators such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta), and pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus). In those states where eastern fox squirrels are not protected, they are considered a game animal. Eastern fox squirrels were an important source of meat for European settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries and are still hunted for food over most of their range. They are hunted more for trophy than for food. Overharvest by hunting has been reported from small woodlots and public shooting areas in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana."}, {"description": "Female eastern fox squirrels come into estrus in mid-December or early January then again in June. They normally produce two litters a year, however, yearling females may only produce one. Females become sexually mature at 10 to 11 months of age and usually produce their first litter when they are a year old.Gestation occurs over a period of 44 to 45 days. Earliest litters appear in late January; most births occur in mid-March and July. The average litter size is three, but can vary according to season and food conditions.Tree squirrels develop slowly compared to other rodents. At birth, the young are blind, without fur and helpless. Eyes open at 4 to 5 weeks of age and ears open at 6 weeks. Eastern fox squirrels are weaned between 8 and 10 weeks but may not be self-supporting until 12 weeks.

It has short, dense fur which is water-repellent. The broad hindfeet are webbed and are used for propulsion through water, moving with alternate strokes.

The yapok's long tail also aids in swimming.Being a marsupial and at the same time an aquatic animal, the water opossum has evolved a way to protect its young while swimming. A strong ring of muscle makes the pouch (which opens to the rear) watertight, so the young remain dry, even when the mother is totally immersed in water. The male also has a pouch (although not as watertight as the female's), where he places his genitalia before swimming. This is thought to prevent it from becoming tangled in aquatic vegetation and is probably helpful in streamlining the animal as well."}, {"description": "The water opossum seems to have a history dating as far back as to the Pliocene epoch.Holocene subfossil fragments of Chironectes have been discovered in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

There are sensory facial bristles in tufts above each eye as well as whiskers. The animal's tail, furred and black at the base, is yellow or white at its end. The hindfeet of the yapok are webbed, while the forefeet (\"hands\") are not. The forefeet can be used to feel for and grab prey as the yapok swims, propelled by its tail and webbed back feet."}, {"description": "Yapoks mate in December and a litter of 1-5 young is born 12 to 14 days later in the nest. By 22 days the offspring are beginning to show some fur, and by 40 days or so their eyes are open, their bodies protruding from the mother's pouch.

They are about the same length as the northern walrus, but usually less than half the weight.Leopard Seals, Hydrurga leptonyx. marinebio.orgIts front teeth are sharp like those of other carnivores, but its molars lock together in a way that allows them to sieve krill from the water, in the manner of the crab eater seal."}, {"description": "The leopard seal lives in the cold waters surrounding Antarctica. During the summer months, it hunts among the pack ice surrounding the continent, spending almost all of its time in the water. In the winter, it ranges north to the sub-Antarctic islands. Occasionally, individuals may be spotted on the southern coasts of Argentina, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand, and as far north as the Cook Islands. Juveniles are more often found in the north.The leopard seal is a solitary creature and comes together in small groups only when it is time to mate. During the mating season, males and females make acoustic calls to each other over distances, with at least the males having individual variability in their vocalising sequence patterns. After a 9-month gestation, the female digs a hole in the ice, and gives birth to a single pup during the Antarctic summer. She protects the pup until it is able to fend for itself.Leopard seals are not very vocal, although they occasionally make some grunting and growling noises.The leopard seal is bold, powerful and curious. In the water, there is a fine line between curiosity and predatory behaviour, and it may 'play' with penguins it does not intend to eat. There are also records of leopard seals attacking divers. Paul Nicklen, a National Geographic magazine photographer, captured pictures of a leopard seal bringing live, injured, and then dead penguins to him, possibly in an attempt to teach the photographer how to hunt.http://www.dpreview.com/news/2012/10/18/National-Geographic-Photographer-Paul-Nicklen-surprise-encounter-with-Leopard-Seal-Antarctica Diet The leopard seal is second only to the killer whale among Antarctica's top predators. Its canine teeth are 2.5 cm. It feeds on a wide variety of creatures. Smaller seals probably eat mostly krill, but also squid and fish. Larger leopard seals probably switch from krill to more substantial prey, including king, adelie, rockhopper, gentoo, emperor, and chinstrap penguins, and less frequently, other seals, such as crabeater seal.Around the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) is the main prey. Other prey include penguins and fish. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups and seabirds other than penguins have also been found in leopard seal scats in small quantities.When hunting penguins, the leopard seal patrols the waters near the edges of the ice, almost completely submerged, waiting for the birds to enter the ocean. It kills the swimming bird by grabbing the feet, then shaking the penguin vigorously and beating its body against the surface of the water repeatedly until the penguin is dead. Previous reports stating the leopard seal skins its prey before feeding have been found to be incorrect. Lacking the teeth necessary to slice its prey into manageable pieces, it flails its prey from side to side tearing and ripping it into smaller pieces."}, {"description": "Leopard seals are potentially highly dangerous towards humans, but attacks are rarely reported. Examples of aggressive behaviour, stalking and attacks have been documented. Notable incidents include: A large leopard seal attacked Thomas Orde-Lees (1877\u20131958), a member of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u20131917 when the expedition was camping on the sea ice. A large \"sea leopard\" of about 12 ft long and 1100 lb chased Orde-Lees on the ice. He was saved only when another member of the expedition shot the animal. In 1985, Scottish explorer Gareth Wood was bitten twice on the leg when a leopard seal tried to drag him off the ice and into the sea. His companions managed to save him by repeatedly kicking the animal in the head with the spiked crampons on their boots.Carrington, Damian (2003-07-24). Inquiry into fatal leopard seal attack begins. NewScientist.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-24. In 2003, a leopard seal dragged snorkeling biologist Kirsty Brown of the British Antarctic Survey nearly 200 ft underwater to her death, in what was identified as the first known human fatality from a leopard seal. Leopard seals have shown a particular predilection for attacking the black, torpedo-shaped pontoons of rigid inflatable boats, necessitating researchers to equip their craft with special protective guards to prevent them from being punctured."}, {"description": "The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), also referred to as the sea leopard, is the second largest species of seal in the Antarctic (after the southern elephant seal).

It can live 26 years, possibly more.Leopard seals are predators, feeding mainly on other seals, penguins, fish, and krill. Killer whales are the only known, albeit infrequent, natural predators of leopard seals.Hill, Anna. (2013) Hydrurga leptonyx. Animal Diversity Web.

When confronted, the African wildcat raises its hair to make itself seem larger in order to intimidate its opponent. In the daytime it usually hides in the bushes, although it is sometimes active on dark, cloudy days. The territory of a male overlaps with that of a few females, who defend the territory against intruders. A female gives birth to two to six kittens, with three being average. The African wildcat often rests and gives birth in burrows or hollows in the ground. The gestation lasts between 56 and 69 days. The kittens are born blind and need the full care of the mother.

Beim Gesicht wirkt es fast so, als w\u00e4re es nachtr\u00e4glich gezeichnet, die Fellfarben verst\u00e4rken den charakteristischen Kopf dieses Tieres. Das Fell ist an Kehle und Wangen manchmal, aber nicht immer, wei\u00df.Miguel Padilla und Robert C. Dowler: Tapirus terrestris. Mammalian Species 481, 1994, S. 1\u20138Der K\u00f6rperbau gleicht dem der \u00fcbrigen Tapire, charakteristisch ist vor allem der stark gew\u00f6lbte Kopf und die sehr bewegliche r\u00fcsselartige Nase, die mit der Oberlippe verbunden ist. Der K\u00f6rperbau wirkt gedrungen, ist aber sehr muskul\u00f6s. Die Beine sind st\u00e4mmig und kurz. Die Vorderbeine enden beim Flachlandtapir, wie bei allen Tapiren, in vier Zehen, die Hinterbeine in nur drei. Die Zehen sind mit Hufen verkleidet und spreizen sich beim Gehen auseinander, wodurch das Einsinken in weiche B\u00f6den verhindert wird. Die Augen sind relativ klein und seitlich am Kopf. Sch\u00e4del- und GebissmerkmaleDer Sch\u00e4del des Flachlandtapirs wird rund 37 cm lang und ist dabei langgestreckt geformt und eher flach. Charakteristisch ist der hohe Scheitelkamm, der nur beim Flachlandtapir so stark ausgepr\u00e4gt ist und den konvex geformten Kopf bewirkt. Im Gegensatz zu anderen S\u00e4ugetieren mit einer derartigen Knochenbildung ist diese aber nicht paarig in der fr\u00fchen Individualentwicklung angelegt, sondern entsteht offensichtlich postnatal durch Knochenanreicherung und unterscheidet sich dadurch von den Scheitelk\u00e4mmen der anderen heutigen Tapirarten.Luke T. Holbrook: The unusual development of the sagittal crest in the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Journal of Zoology 256, 2002, S. 215\u2013219 Das Hinterhauptsbein weist eine deutlich kurze und rechtwinklige Form auf. Das Nasenbein ist eher schwach gebaut und liegt wie bei allen Tapiren weit hinter dem Zwischenkieferknochen, beide Knochen sind nicht miteinander verbunden.Luke T. Holbrook: Comparative osteology of early Tertiary tapiromorphs (Mammalia, Perissodactyla). Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 132, 2001, S. 1\u201354Der Unterkiefer besitzt eine L\u00e4nge von 29 cm, wobei der Unterkieferk\u00f6rper relativ niedrig ist. Die Zahnanzahl ist wenig reduziert und weist bei erwachsenen Tieren folgende Gebissformel auf: \\frac{3.1.4.3}{3.1.3.3}. Im Oberkiefer sind die jeweils dritten Schneidez\u00e4hne vergr\u00f6\u00dfert und dolchartig geformt, die restlichen dagegen eher klein, so wie auch alle Incisiven des Unterkiefers. Zum nachfolgenden Eckzahn besteht ein kleines Diastema. Der Eckzahn des Unterkiefers ist sehr gro\u00df und konisch spitz gebaut. Er steht dem dritten Schneidezahn des Oberkiefers gegen\u00fcber, wodurch beide Z\u00e4hne ein kr\u00e4ftiges Bei\u00dfwerkzeug bilden. Der Oberkiefereckzahn dagegen ist markant reduziert, allgemein weisen die Eckz\u00e4hne wenig Zahnzement auf. Zur hinteren Bezahnung besteht ein deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dferes Diastema. Die Pr\u00e4molaren sind deutlich molarisiert, das hei\u00dft, sie \u00e4hneln den hinteren Backenz\u00e4hnen, den Molaren. Diese sind durch zwei querstehende Zahnschmelzleisten gekennzeichnet (bilophodont) mit jeweils h\u00f6ckerigen Bildungen an den Enden. Allgemein sind die Backenz\u00e4hne sehr niederkronig (brachyodont). Sinnesleistungen und Laut\u00e4u\u00dferungenDie bestentwickelten Sinne des Flachlandtapirs sind der feine Geruchssinn ebenso wie der exzellente Tastsinn. Fast genauso gut funktionieren seine Ohren mit ihrem guten Geh\u00f6r, wobei der Flachlandtapir zwischen den unterschiedlichsten Ger\u00e4uschen (Fressfeinde, Artgenossen) differenzieren kann und dementsprechend reagiert.Susanne Zenzinger: Experimentelle Untersuchungen zur akustischen Kommunikation bei im Zoo gehaltenen Schabracken- und Flachlandtapiren (Tapirus indicus und Tapirus terrestris). Der Zoologische Garten N.F. 79, 2010, S. 254\u2013267 Die Augen dagegen sind schwach, das Tier ist eher kurzsichtig. Allerdings zeigten Untersuchungen, dass der Sehsinn f\u00fcr die Tiere im Nahbereich auch eine wichtige optische Kommunikationshilfe darstellt, da sie auf bestimmte Schl\u00fcsselreize wie den R\u00fcssel oder die wei\u00dfen Ohrr\u00e4nder reagieren.Susanne Zenzinger: Experimentelle Untersuchungen zur optischen Kommunikation bei im Zoo gehaltenen Schabracken- und Flachlandtapiren (Tapirus indicus und Tapirus terrestris). Der Zoologische Garten N.F. 79, 2010, S. 162\u2013174Der Flachlandtapir nutzt verschiedene Laut\u00e4u\u00dferungen zur Kommunikation. Bekannt sind zwei schrille Laute, die die Tiere bei Gefahr oder Schmerz aussto\u00dfen. Ein Klicklaut, der mit der Zunge und dem Gaumen erzeugt wird, dient der Erkennung von Artgenossen, w\u00e4hrend ein Schnauben Aggression oder Wut ausdr\u00fcckt.Don Hunsaker II und John C.

So wurden w\u00e4hrend einer einj\u00e4hrigen Untersuchung von 1993 bis 1994 bei der Waimiri Atroari-Volksgruppe des zentralen Amazonastieflandes festgestellt, dass die damals 800 Personen umfassende indigene Gruppe innerhalb dieses Zeitraumes insgesamt 131 Flachlandtapire erlegte mit einem Gesamtgewicht von 19,5 t, was rund 45 % der gesamten gejagten Biomasse ausmachte.Roselis Remor de Souza-Mazurek, Temehe Pedrinho, Xinymy Feliciano, Warai\u00e9 Hil\u00e1rio, Sanapyty Ger\u00f4ncio und Ewepe Marcelo: Subsistence hunting among the Waimiri Atroari Indians in central Amazonia, Brazil. Biodiversity and Conservation 9, 2000, S. 579\u2013596 Weiterhin ist die fortschreitende Zerst\u00f6rung des Lebensraums durch Waldrodungen ein gro\u00dfes Problem. Infolge der Lebensraumzerst\u00f6rung tritt der Flachlandtapir auch als Kulturfolger auf. An den Waldr\u00e4ndern dringt er manchmal auf Zuckerrohr- oder Kakao-Plantagen vor. Nicht selten enden diese Vorst\u00f6\u00dfe mit der Erschie\u00dfung des Tieres. Aufgrund seines gro\u00dfen Verbreitungsgebietes ist er noch h\u00e4ufiger als die beiden anderen amerikanischen Tapirarten, der Mittelamerikanische und der Bergtapir anzutreffen. Dennoch sind die Bestandszahlen im Sinken, weswegen er von der IUCN als gef\u00e4hrdet (vulnerable) gelistet wird. Lokal ist der Flachlandtapir bereits in seinen \u00f6stlichen, s\u00fcdlichen und nordwestlichen Randgebieten ausgestorben.A. Naveda, B. de Thoisy, C. Richard-Hansen, D. A. Torres, L. Salas, R. Wallance, S. Chalukian und S. de Bustos: [ Tapirus terrestris]. In: IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Version 2012.2 Zum weiteren Schutz der Tierart wurde 2006 ein Programm initiiert, einzelne Tiere gezielt wieder in Nationalparks neu anzusiedeln, was von einer Gruppe der Tapir Specialist Group der IUCN koordiniert wird (TSG Re-Introduction and Translocation Advisory Committee).Patr\u00edcia Medici: TSG Tapir Re-Introduction & Translocation Advisory Committee. Tapir Conservation 17 (1), 2008, S. 28\u201329Von allen Tapiren wird der Flachlandtapir am h\u00e4ufigsten in Zoos gezeigt. Es wird berichtet, dass sich junge Tapire an Menschen gew\u00f6hnen und sich gut z\u00e4hmen lassen, so dass sogar Kinder auf ihnen reiten k\u00f6nnen. In einigen s\u00fcdamerikanischen Gebieten dient die Tapirart auch als Haustier."}, {"description": "TerritorialverhaltenFlehmender Flachlandtapir Der Flachlandtapir ist wie alle Tapirarten nachtaktiv. Tags\u00fcber zieht er sich ins dichte Unterholz zur\u00fcck, um in der Nacht auf Nahrungssuche zu gehen. Dabei wandert ein Tier zu den verschiedensten Pl\u00e4tzen, wie Futterstellen, Salzlecken oder Badepl\u00e4tzen in seinem Areal und legt so Pfade an. Im normalen Laufschritt bewegt er sich mit gesenktem Kopf vorw\u00e4rts, im Spurt oder auf der Flucht dagegen mit erh\u00f6hter Kopfhaltung. Der Flachlandtapir ist au\u00dferdem ein guter Schwimmer und vermag zu tauchen.Als territorialer Einzelg\u00e4nger lebt der Flachlandtapir solit\u00e4r, kleine Gruppen, au\u00dfer in der Paarungszeit, umfassen in der Regel Muttertiere mit Kalb. Begegnungen unter Artgenossen k\u00f6nnen mitunter sehr aggressiv verlaufen. Vor allem m\u00e4nnliche Tiere markieren ihre Reviere und Pfade mit Urin und Dung, die h\u00e4ufig an dieselben Stellen gesetzt werden. Das Beschn\u00fcffeln der F\u00e4kalien dient als eine der wichtigsten innerartlichen Kommunikationen. Sofern die Tiere fremde Hinterlassenschaften auffinden, beginnen sie zu flehmen. Ern\u00e4hrungDer Flachlandtapir ist ein auf vorwiegend weiche Pflanzenteile spezialisiertes Tier, was sich auch in seiner Anatomie durch die stark bewegliche r\u00fcsselartige Oberlippe und die niederkronigen Backenz\u00e4hne mit den charakteristischen Schmelzbuckeln widerspiegelt. Neben Bl\u00e4ttern verzehren die Tiere auch Wasserpflanzen, Knospen, Zweige und Fr\u00fcchte. Dabei sind \u00fcber 270 verschiedene Pflanzenarten bekannt, die der Flachlandtapir konsumiert. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren Hundsgift-, Palmen- und Sapotengew\u00e4chse. Fr\u00fcchte wie Feigen oder Sumachgew\u00e4chse nehmen insgesamt einen sehr hohen Anteil im Nahrungsspektrum ein, die aber abh\u00e4ngig von den Wuchszeiten verzehrt und somit nicht ganzj\u00e4hrig aufgenommen werden k\u00f6nnen. Da die Samen bei der Verdauung weitgehend intakt bleiben, tr\u00e4gt der Flachlandtapir durch seine Wanderungen zur Ausbreitung zahlreicher Pflanzenarten bei.Mathias W. Tobler, John C. Janovec und Fernando Cornejo: Frugivory and Seed Dispersal by the Lowland Tapir Tapirus terrestris in the Peruvian Amazon. Biotropica 42 (2), 2010, S. 215\u2013222 Eine gro\u00dfe Bedeutung haben auch Salzlecken oder offene Bodenstellen, an denen der Flachlandtapir Mineralien zu sich nimmt, einerseits um seinen Stoffkreislauf auszugleichen, andererseits um Pflanzengifte unsch\u00e4dlich zu machen.Igor Pfeifer Coelho, Luiz Flamarion B.

Tapir Conservation 17 (2), 2008, S. 5\u201310 FortpflanzungJungtier im Dortmunder Zoo Mit rund zwei bis zweieinhalb Jahren ist der Flachlandtapir geschlechtsreif. Die Brunft des weiblichen Tieres findet alle 50 bis 80 Tage statt und h\u00e4lt bis zu zwei Tage lang an. W\u00e4hrend dieser Zeit werben die m\u00e4nnlichen Tiere um das Weibchen, indem sie ihr folgen, an den Ohren zupfen oder spielen. Der Kopulation gehen charakteristische Kreiselbewegungen, Flehmen oder hohes Wimmern voraus. Der Geschlechtsakt selbst kann im oder au\u00dferhalb eines Gew\u00e4ssers stattfinden.Nach rund 335- bis 439-t\u00e4giger Tragzeit bringt das Weibchen meist ein einzelnes Jungtier zur Welt, Zwillinge sind sehr selten. Ein neugeborener Flachlandtapir wiegt rund 4 bis 7 Kilogramm und ist wie alle Tapirk\u00e4lber mit hellen Flecken oder Streifen versehen, die der Tarnung dienen. In den ersten Lebenstagen bleibt es in einem gesch\u00fctzten Lager, nach rund einer Woche begleitet es die Mutter auf ihren Streifz\u00fcgen. Nur wenige Tage nach der Geburt nimmt das Kalb schon Pflanzennahrung zu sich, saugt aber weiterhin Milch und wird nach rund sechs bis zehn Monaten entw\u00f6hnt. In den ersten vierzehn Tagen kann sich das Gewicht der Neugeborenen verdreifachen. Die Tarnkleidung verliert das Jungtier nach f\u00fcnf bis acht Monaten. Insgesamt verweilt es rund 18 Monate beim Muttertier, bis es ausgewachsen und geschlechtsreif ist. Die Lebenserwartung betr\u00e4gt 25 bis 30 Jahre, das H\u00f6chstalter eines Tieres in menschlicher Obhut war 35 Jahre. Interaktionen mit anderen TierartenDer Flachlandtapir hat eine positive \u00f6kologische Beziehung zu zahlreichen anderen Tierarten, da er auf seinen Wanderungen Pfade anlegt, die diese dann ebenfalls nutzen. Als scheues und vorsichtiges Tier neigt der Flachlandtapir eher zur Flucht in Dickichte und W\u00e4lder oder auch in Gew\u00e4sser, er kann sich aber bei Gefahr mit seinen spitzen Eck- und Schneidez\u00e4hnen sowie den Hufen effektiv verteidigen. Zu seinen nat\u00fcrlichen Feinden z\u00e4hlen neben dem Jaguar auch der Puma und verschiedene Krokodile. Nur selten kommt es zu Angriffen des Flachlandtapirs auf den Menschen.Vidal Haddad Jr, Melissa Chagas Assunc\u00e3o, Ricardo Coelho de Mello und Marcelo Ribeiro Duarte: A Fatal Attack Caused by a Lowland Tapir (Tapirus terrestris) in Southeastern Brazil.

Many of Reynard's adventures may stem from actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes.Chinese folk tales tell of fox-spirits called huli jing that may have up to nine tails, or kumiho as they are known in Korea. In Japanese mythology, the kitsune are fox-like spirits possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. Foremost among these is the ability to assume human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others, other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. In Arab folklore, the fox is considered a cowardly, weak, deceitful and cunning animal, said to feign death by filling its abdomen with air in order to appear bloated, then lies on its side, awaiting the approach of unwitting prey. The animal's cunning was noted by the authors of the Bible, and applied the word \"fox\" to false prophets (Ezekiel 13:4) and the hypocrisy of Herod Antipas (Luke 13:32).The cunning Fox is commonly found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion who often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, who leave just before the arrival of humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf. Hunting The earliest historical records of fox hunting come from the 4th century BC; Alexander the Great is known to have hunted foxes and a seal dated from 350\u00a0BC depicts a Persian horseman in the process of spearing a fox. Xenophon, who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The Romans were hunting foxes by 80\u00a0AD. During the Dark Ages in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. Cnut the Great reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 13th century, Edward I had a royal pack of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. Edward, Second Duke of York assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his The Master of Game. By the Renaissance, fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the English Civil War saw a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-17th century, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the Charlton Hunt Club in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 18th century. Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and Maryland in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters. These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species. Red foxes are still widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths among the highest causes of mortality in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500\u201325,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000\u20132001); Austria 58,000 (2000\u20132001); Sweden 58,000 (1999\u20132000); Finland 56,000 (2000\u20132001); Denmark 50,000 (1976\u20131977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000\u20132001); Saskatchewan (Canada) 2,000 (2000\u20132001); Nova Scotia (Canada) 491 (2000\u20132001); Minnesota (USA) 4,000-8,000 (average annual trapping harvest 2002-2009); New Mexico (USA) 69 (1999\u20132000). Fur use Red foxes are among the most important furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarfs and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarfs exceeds the total number of scarfs made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively. In the early 20th century, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985\u201386 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50\u00a0million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness. Livestock, game and pet predation Red foxes are implicated in the destruction of game and song birds, hares, rabbits, muskrats and young ungulates, particularly in preserves, reserves, and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, as well as in poultry farms. Foxes may on occasions prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young. It is often the case that the extent of game and livestock predation by red foxes is exaggerated, since the degree of fox damage is usually determined by the remains of food found at their burrows.Red foxes may prey on domestic rabbits and guinea pigs if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food. Taming and domesticationIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.A strain of truly domesticated red foxes was introduced by Russian geneticist Dmitry Konstantinovich Belyaev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyaev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves. Urban foxes DistributionRed foxes thrive particularly well in urban environments. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering Bristol and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in Cambridge and Norwich. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in Melbourne as early as the 1930s, while in Zurich, Switzerland, they only starting appearing in the 1980s. Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, commerce or council-rented houses predominate. In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from 80 to 90 hectares, whereas those in more residential areas average from 25 to 40 hectares. In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. BehaviourUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs. Urban fox controlThe urban fox has become quite a problem for some people. Disrupting rubbish bins, stealing chickens and wrecking gardens, the urban fox can become a nuisance. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return. Relationship between urban and rural foxesIn January 2014 it was reported that \"Fleet\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the University of Brighton in partnership with the BBC's Winterwatch, had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in Hove, at the western edge of East Sussex, across rural countryside as far as Rye, at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the GPS collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the country, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations."}, {"description": "Red foxes are wide ranging animals, whose range covers nearly 70\u00a0million km2 (27\u00a0million mi2). They are distributed across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America, and Asia. They are absent in Iceland, the Arctic islands, some parts of Siberia, and in extreme deserts.Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concernRed foxes are not present in New Zealand and are classed as a \"prohibited new organism\" under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported. Australia In Australia, 2012 estimates indicate that there are more than 7.2\u00a0million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian Devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it has become one of the continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the Potoroidae family including the Desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties.(Refers to the book Australia's Mammal Extinctions: a 50,000 year history. Christopher N. Johnson. ISBN 978-0-521-68660-0.) According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the Eastern Bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established. SardiniaThe origin of the Sardinian ichnusae subspecies is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity."}, {"description": "The red fox is considered a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes in the direction of size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox. OriginsThe species is Eurasian in origin, and may have evolved from either Vulpes alopecoides or the related Chinese V.\u00a0chikushanensis, both of which lived during the Middle Villafranchian. The earliest fossil specimens of V.\u00a0vulpes were uncovered in Barany, Hungary dating from between 3.4 and 1.8\u00a0million years ago.PaleoDatabase collection No. 35369, authorized by Alan Turner, Liverpool John Moores University. Entry by H. O'Regan, 8 December 2003 The ancestral species was likely smaller than the current one, as the earliest red fox fossils are smaller than modern populations. The earliest fossil remains of the modern species date back to the mid-Pleistocene in association with the refuse of early human settlements. This has led to the theory that the red fox was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts. Colonisation of North AmericaRed foxes colonised the North American continent in two waves: during or before the Illinoian glaciation, and during the Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping demonstrates that red foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and that the previous binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, red fox fossils have been found in Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) refugium occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.\u00a0v.\u00a0alascensis, V.\u00a0v.\u00a0abietorum, V.\u00a0v.\u00a0regalis and V.\u00a0v.\u00a0rubricosa. The southern (or montane) refugium occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.\u00a0v.\u00a0macroura, V.\u00a0v.\u00a0cascadensis and V.\u00a0v.\u00a0necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations. Subspecies , 45 subspecies are recognised. In 2010, another possible distinct subspecies was discovered in Sacramento Valley through mitochondrial haplotype studies.Substantial gene pool mixing between different subspecies is known; British red foxes have crossbred extensively with foxes imported from Germany, France, Belgium, Sardinia, and possibly Siberia and Scandinavia. European foxes were introduced to portions of the USA in the 18th century, thus crossbreeding with local North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes in California may be interbreeding with local V.\u00a0v.\u00a0necator populations. Red fox subspecies are divided into two categories: Northern foxes are large and brightly coloured. Southern grey desert foxes include the Asian subspecies V.\u00a0v.\u00a0griffithi, V.\u00a0v.\u00a0pusilla and V.\u00a0v.\u00a0flavescens. These foxes display transitional features between northern red foxes and smaller fox species; their skulls possess more primitive, neotenous traits than the northern forms, and are much smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern foxes are invariably less than the average sizes of northern foxes. Their limbs are also longer, and their ears larger. Red foxes living in Middle Asia show physical traits intermediate to the northern and southern forms.

In the former Soviet Union, up to 300 animal and a few dozen plant species are known to be consumed by them. They primarily feed on small, mouse-like rodents like voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils, woodchucks, pocket gophers and deer mice. Secondary prey species include birds (with passeriformes, galliformes and waterfowl predominating), leporids, porcupines, raccoons, opossums, reptiles, insects, other invertebrates and flotsam (marine mammals, fish and echinoderms). On very rare occasions, they may attack young or small ungulates.Heptner, V. G. (Vladimir Georgievich); Nasimovich, A. A; Bannikov, Andrei Grigorevich; Hoffmann, Robert S, Mammals of the Soviet Union, v. 1 (1988), Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian Institution Libraries and National Science Foundation They typically target mammals up to about 3.5 kg in weight, and require 500 g of food daily. Red foxes readily eat plant material and in some areas, fruit can amount to 100% of their diet in autumn. Commonly consumed fruits include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, persimmons, mulberries, apples, plums, grapes and acorns. Other plant material includes grasses, sedges and tubers.Red foxes prefer to hunt in the early morning hours before sunrise and late evening. Although they typically forage alone, they may aggregate in resource-rich environments. When hunting mouse-like prey, they first pinpoint their prey's location by sound, then leap, sailing high above their quarry, steering in mid-air with their tails, before landing on target up to 5 m away. They typically only feed on carrion in the late evening hours and at night. They are extremely possessive of their food, and will defend their catches from even dominant animals. Red foxes may occasionally commit acts of surplus killing; during one breeding season, four foxes were recorded to have killed circa 200 black-headed gulls each, with peaks during dark, windy hours when flying conditions were unfavourable. Losses to poultry and penned game birds can be substantial because of this. Red foxes seem to dislike the taste of moles, but will nonetheless catch them alive and present them to their kits as playthings.A 2008\u20132010 study of 84 Red foxes in the Czech Republic and Germany found that successful hunting in long vegetation or under snow appeared to involve an alignment of the fox with the Earth's magnetic field.Jaroslav \u010cerven\u00fd, Sabine Begall, Petr Koubek, Petra Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 and Hynek Burda. (2011) Directional preference may enhance hunting accuracy in foraging foxes. 12 January 2011 doi: 10.1098/rsbl.2010.1145; Biol. Lett. 23 June 2011 vol. 7 no. 3 355-357. http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/3/355.full Enemies and competitors Red foxes typically dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s\u20131930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than 10 cm and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, Blanford's foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.Wolves may kill and eat red foxes in disputes over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges tend to be located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red foxes share their habitat with golden jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. Foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of foxes decreases significantly, apparently because of competitive exclusion.Red foxes dominate raccoon dogs, sometimes killing their kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In Tartaria, red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia.Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats and young sables. Eurasian badgers may live alongside red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It is possible that the two species tolerate each other out of commensalism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.Heptner, V. G. (Vladimir Georgievich), 1901\u20131975; Nasimovich, A. A; Bannikov, Andrei Grigorevich; Hoffmann, Robert S Mammals of the Soviet Union Volume: v. 2, pt. 1b (2001) Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian Institution Libraries and National Science FoundationRed foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.Heptner, V. G. and Sludskii, A. A. 1992. Mammals of the Soviet Union. Vol. II, part 2, Carnivores (Feloidea), Leiden, E. J. Brill. ISBN 90-04-08876-8In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes into deep snow, where their longer legs and larger paws give them an advantage over foxes, especially when the depth of the snow exceeds one metre.Heptner, V. G. and Sludskii, A. A. 1992. Mammals of the Soviet Union. Vol. II, part 2, Carnivores (Feloidea), Leiden, E. J. Brill. ISBN 90-04-08876-8, pp. 627\u2013628 In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes,Eurasian Eagle Owl \u2013 Bubo bubo. owlpages.com while golden eagles have been known to kill adults."}, {"description": "Red foxes are the most important rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.Red foxes are not readily prone to infestation with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.\u00a0hexagonus are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei is the most important cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.Up to 60 helminth species are known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria plica infect the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.\u00a0pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.\u00a0multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes."}, {"description": "Build The red fox has an elongated body and relatively short limbs. The tail, which is longer than half the body length (70% of head and body length), is fluffy and reaches the ground when in a standing position. Their pupils are oval and vertically oriented. Nictitating membranes are present, but move only when the eyes are closed. The forepaws have five digits, while the hind feet have only four and lack dewclaws. They are very agile, being capable of jumping over 2 m high fences, and swim well. Vixens normally have four pairs of teats, though vixens with seven, nine or ten teats are not uncommon. The testes of males are smaller than those of Arctic foxes.Their skulls are fairly narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are relatively long. Sexual dimorphism of the skull is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth and their concave rather than convex profiles. DimensionsRed foxes are the largest species of the genus Vulpes. However, relative to dimensions, red foxes are much lighter than similarly sized dogs of the genus Canis. Their limb bones, for example, weigh 30% less per unit area of bone than expected for similarly sized dogs. They display significant individual, sexual, age and geographical variation in size. On average, adults measure 35 \u2013 high at the shoulder and 45 to in body length with tails measuring 30 to. The ears measure 7.7\u201312.5\u00a0cm (3\u20135\u00a0in) and the hind feet 12\u201318.5\u00a0cm (5\u20137\u00a0in). They weigh 2.2 to, with vixens typically weighing 15\u201320% less than males.Burnie D and Wilson DE (eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), ISBN 0789477645 Adult red foxes have skulls measuring 129 \u2013, while those of vixens measure 128 \u2013. The forefoot print measures 60 mm in length and 45 mm in width, while the hind foot print measures 55 mm long and 38 mm wide. They trot at a speed of 6\u201313\u00a0km/h, and have a maximum running speed of 50\u00a0km/h. They have a stride of 25 \u2013 when walking at a normal pace. North American red foxes are generally lightly built, with comparatively long bodies for their mass and have a high degree of sexual dimorphism. British red foxes are heavily built, but short, while continental European red foxes are closer to the general average among red fox populations. The largest red fox on record in Great Britain was a 17.2\u00a0kg (38.1\u00a0lbs), 1.4 m long male, killed in Aberdeenshire, Scotland in early 2012. FurThe winter fur is dense, soft, silky and relatively long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades which, together with the spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower surface of the body is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present at the base of the tail. The tip of the tail is white. Mutations Atypical colourations in red foxes usually represent stages toward full melanism, and mostly occur in cold regions. Colour variant Image Description Red The typical colouration.

Their auditory perception is acute, being able to hear black grouses changing roosts at 600 paces, the flight of crows at 0.25 \u2013 and the squeaking of mice at about 100 m. They are capable of locating sounds to within one degree at 700\u20133,000\u00a0Hz, though less accurately at higher frequencies. Their sense of smell is good, but weaker than that of specialised dogs. Scent glandsRed foxes have a pair of anal sacs lined by sebaceous glands, both of which open through a single duct. The anal sacs act as fermentation chambers in which aerobic and anaerobic bacteria convert sebum into odorous compounds, including aliphatic acids. The oval-shaped caudal gland is 25 mm long and 13 mm wide, and reportedly smells of violets.In a freshly killed animal, this gland, especially in freezing weather, gives off the odor of violet. This odor is not strong and rapidly disappears especially in a dead animal taken into a warm location. This explains why the presence of the \"violet\" odor is sometimes negated. The presence of foot glands is equivocal. The interdigital cavities are deep, with a reddish tinge and smell strongly. Sebaceous glands are present on the angle of the jaw and mandible."}, {"description": "Body language Red fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together. Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex. VocalisationsRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five octaves, which grade into each other. Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits. The majority of sounds can be divided into \"contact\" and \"interaction\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression. Contact calls: The most commonly heard contact call is a 3\u20135 syllable barking \"wow wow wow\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of tawny owls). The \"wow wow wow\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \"wow wow wow\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises. Interaction calls: When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a ratchet, called \"gekkering\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances. Another call which does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \"waaaaah\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied."}, {"description": "Social and territorial behaviourRed foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine is also used to mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not to waste time investigating them. The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number 1 or 2, sometimes up to 8 in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, they will stay with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction. Reproduction and development Red foxes reproduce once a year in spring. Two months prior to oestrus (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their uterine horns double in size, and their ovaries grow 1.5\u20132 times larger. Sperm formation in males begins in August\u2013September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December\u2013February. The vixen's oestrus period lasts three weeks, during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. Copulation is accompanied by a copulatory tie which may last for more than an hour. The copulatory tie occurs when the bulbus glandis at the base of the male fox's penis enlarges. The gestation period lasts 49\u201358 days. Though foxes are largely monogamous, DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny, incest and mixed paternity litters. Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to whelp, or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates.The average litter size consists of four to six kits, though litters of up to 13 kits have occurred. Large litters are typical in areas where fox mortality is high. Kits are born blind, deaf and toothless, with dark brown fluffy fur. At birth, they weigh 56 \u2013 and measure 14.5 cm in body length and 7.5 cm in tail length. At birth, they are short-legged, large-headed and have broad chests. Mothers remain with the kits for 2\u20133 weeks, as they are unable to thermoregulate. During this period, the fathers or barren vixens feed the mothers. Vixens are very protective of their kits, and have been known to even fight off terriers in their defence. If the mother dies before the kits are independent, the father takes over as their provider. The kit's eyes open after 13\u201315 days, during which time their ear canals open and their upper teeth erupt, with the lower teeth emerging 3\u20134 days later. Their eyes are initially blue, but change to amber at 4\u20135 weeks. Coat colour begins to change at 3 weeks of age, when the black eye streak appears. By one month, red and white patches are apparent on their faces. During this time, their ears erect and their muzzles elongate. Kits begin to leave their dens and experiment with solid food brought by their parents at the age of 3\u20134 weeks. The lactation period lasts 6\u20137 weeks. Their woolly coats begin to be coated by shiny guard hairs after 8 weeks. By the age of 3\u20134 months, the kits are long-legged, narrow-chested and sinewy. They reach adult proportions at the age of 6\u20137 months. Some vixens may reach sexual maturity at the age of 9\u201310 months, thus bearing their first litters at one year of age. In captivity, their longevity can be as long as 15 years, though in the wild they typically do not survive past 5 years of age. Denning behaviour Outside the breeding season, most red foxes favour living in the open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather. Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years. They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease. In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the burrows of wolves, porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40\u201345\u00b0) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from 0.5 \u2013, rarely extending to ground water. The main passage can reach 17 m in length, standing an average of 5 \u2013. In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over 2 m from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. They may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers. Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens. The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day."}, {"description": "The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and the most abundant member of the Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America and Asia. It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included among the list of the \"world's 100 worst invasive species\".The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and the Middle East.Red foxes are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families, such as a mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits. The species primarily feeds on small rodents, though it may also target rabbits, game birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.The species has a long history of association with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology.

It is the only extant species in the ancient order Microbiotheria, and the sole New World representative of the superorder Australidelphia (all other New World marsupials are members of Ameridelphia). The species is nocturnal and arboreal, and lives in thickets of South American mountain bamboo in the Valdivian temperate rain forests of the southern Andes, aided by its partially prehensile tail. It eats primarily insects and other small invertebrates, supplemented with fruit."}, {"description": "For the past few years there has been a decline in the number of Dromiciops, which is now classified as 'near threatened'. There are many contribution factors of the decline:The monito del monte will not be the only organism which will be affected if it becomes endangered. Dromiciops illustrate parasite-host specificity with the tick, Ixodes neuquenensis. This tick can only be found on the monito del monte, so its survival depends on the survival of this nearly endangered mammal. T. corymbosus also depends on the survival of this species, because without the seed dispersal agency of monitor del monte, it would not be able to reproduce.Not much conservation efforts are being undertaken at the moment, but there are ecological studies being conducted in the Chilo\u00e9 Island that may help find future conservation efforts. Dromiciops has been found in the Los Ruiles National Reserve and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, which are protected areas in Chile."}, {"description": "Monitos del monte are carnivorous, primarily insectivores. They eat insects and other invertebrates they find on the branches of trees and cracks in barks. During the summer, they eat large quantities of fruits, specially mistletoe fruit. Seed-Dispersing RoleA study performed in the temperate forests of southern Argentina showed a mutualistic seed dispersal relationship between D. gliroides and Tristerix corymbosus, also known as the Loranthacous mistletoe. The monito del monte is the sole dispersal agent for this plant, and without it the plant would likely become extinct. The monito del monte eats the fruit of T. corymbosus, and then germination takes place in the gut. Scientists speculate that the coevolution of these two species could have begun 60\u201370 million years ago."}, {"description": "Monitos del monte mainly live in trees, where they construct spherical nests of water resistant colihue leaves. These leaves are then lined with moss or grass, and placed in well protected areas of the tree, such as underbrush, tree cavities, or fallen timber.The nests are sometimes covered with grey moss as a form of camouflage. These nests provide the monito del monte with some protection from the cold, both when it is active and when it hibernates.

Dromiciops have the same dental formula as Didelphids: , total of 50 teeth.Their size ranges from 16 -. They have short and dense fur that is primarily brown-gray with patches of white at their shoulders and back, and their underside is more of a cream or light gray color. Monitos del monte also have distinct black rings around their eyes. Their small furred ears are well-rounded and their rostrums are short. The head to body length is around 8 -, and their tail length is between 9 and. Their tails are somewhat prehensile and mostly furred with the exception of 25 - of the underside. The naked underside of their tails may contribute to increasing friction when the mammal is on a tree. The base of their tails also functions as a fat storage organ which they utilize during winter hibernation. In a week, monitos del monte can store enough fat that their body size may double.Sexual DimorphismIt has been observed that at the end of the summer season female Monitos del monte tend to be larger and heavier than male ones. Their tails also vary in size during this time; females have a thicker tail, which suggests that they may need more energy during hibernation. The sexual dimorphism is only seen during this time and not year-round, so this may be a seasonal variation."}, {"description": "It has long been suspected that South American marsupials were ancestral to those of Australia, consistent with the fact that the two continents were connected via Antarctica in the early Cenozoic. Australia\u2019s earliest known marsupial is Djarthia, a primitive mouse-like animal that lived about 55 million years ago. Djarthia had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian, and this research suggested that the monito del monte was the last of a clade which included Djarthia. This implied that the ancestors of the monito del monte might have reached South America via a back-migration from Australia. The time of divergence between the monito del monte and Australian marsupials was estimated to have been 46 million years ago. However, in 2010, analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials, while confirming the placement of the monito del monte in Australidelphia, showed that its lineage is the most basal of that superorder. The study also confirmed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American lineages (Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata, with the former probably branching first). This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America (along with the ancestors of all other living marsupials), and probably reached Australia in a single dispersal event after Microbiotheria split off."}, {"description": "Monitos del monte have a monogamous mating system. The females have well-formed, fur-lined marsupia containing four mammae. They normally reproduce in the spring once a year and can have a litter size varying from one to five. They can feed a maximum of four offspring, so if there are five young, one will not survive. When the young are mature enough to leave the pouch, approximately 5 months, are nursed in a distinctive nest. They are then carried on the mother\u2019s back.

However, recent molecular studies indicate that notoryctids are not closely related to any of the other marsupial families and should be placed in an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia.Furthermore, molecular data suggests that Notoryctemorphia separated from other marsupials around 64 million years ago. Although at this time South America, Antarctica and Australia were still joined the order evolved in Australia for at least 40-50 million. The Riversleigh fossil material suggests that Notoryctes was already well adapted for burrowing and probably lived in the rainforest that covered much of Australia at that time. The increase in aridity at the end of Tertiary was likely one of the key contributing factors to the development of the current highly specialized form of marsupial mole. The marsupial mole had been burrowing long before the Australian deserts came into being."}, {"description": "The Southern Marsupial Mole is small in size, with a head and body length varying from 121 to 159\u00a0mm, a tail length of 21\u201326\u00a0mm and a weight of 40-70 g. The body is covered with short, dense, silky fur with a pale cream to white color often tinted by the iron oxides from the soil which gives it a reddish chestnut brown tint. It has a light brownish pink nose and mouth and no vibrissae.The cone shaped head merges directly with the body, and there is no obvious neck region. The limbs are short and powerful, and digits III and IV of the manus have large spade-like claws. The dentition varies with individuals and, because the molars have a root of only one third of the length, it has been assumed that moles cannot deal with hard food substances. The dorsal surface of the rostrum and the back of the tail have no fur and the skin is heavily keratinized. There is no external evidence of the eyes, and the optic nerve is absent. It does have however a pigment layer where the eyes should be, probably a vestige of the retina. Both lachrymal glands and Jacobson's organ are well developed, and it has been suggested that the former plays a role in lubricating the nasal passages and Jacobson's organ. The external ear openings are covered with fur and do not have a pinnae. The nostrils are small vertical slits right below the shield-like rostrum. Although the brain has been regarded as very primitive and represents the \"lowliest marsupial brain\", the olfactory bulbs and the rubercula olfactoria are very well developed. This seems to suggest that the olfactory sense plays an important role in the marsupial moles' life, as it would be expected for a creature living in an environment lacking visual stimuli. The middle ear seems to be adapted for the reception of low-frequency sounds. AdaptationsThe Southern Marsupial Mole resembles the Namib Desert Golden Mole and other specialized fossorial animals in having a low and unstable body temperature, ranging between 15-30\u00b0C. It does not have an unusually low resting metabolic rate, and the metabolic rate of burrowing is 60 times higher than that of walking or running. Because it lives underground, where the temperature is considerably lower than at the surface, the Southern Marsupial Mole does not seem to have any special adaptations to desert life. It is not known whether it drinks water or not, but due to the infrequence of rain it is assumed that it does not."}, {"description": "The Southern Marsupial Mole was known for thousands of years to the aborigines and was part of their mythology. It was associated with certain sites and dreaming trails such as Uluru and the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara Lands. Aborigines regarded the creature with sympathy, probably due to its harmless nature, and it was only eaten in hard times. Aboriginal people have good tracking skills and generally cooperate with researchers in teaching them these skills and help finding specimens. Their involvement is instrumental in gathering information about the species\u2019 habitat and behavior.Historical records suggest that the Southern Marsupial Mole was relatively common in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There was a large trade in marsupial mole skins in the Flike River region between 1900 and 1920. Large numbers of aborigines arrived at the trading post with 5-6 pelts each for sale to trade for food and other commodities. It is estimated that hundreds to several thousand skins were traded at these meetings, and that at the time the mole was relatively common. Conservation statusSo little is known about the Southern Marsupial Mole that it is difficult to assess its exact distribution and how it varied over the last decades. However circumstantial evidence suggests that their numbers are dwindling. Although the decreasing acquisition rate is difficult to interpret due to the chance nature of the findings, there are reasons for concern. About 90% of medium sized marsupials in arid Australia have become threatened due to cat and fox predation. A recent study indicates that remains of marsupial moles have been found in 5% of the cats and foxes faecal pellets examined. Moles are also sensitive to changes in the availability of their food caused by changing fire regimes and the impact of herbivores. The Southern Marsupial Mole is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to protect this unique species focus on advocating for maintaining a healthy population of moles to better understand their biology and behavior, and for conducting field studies to monitor the species distribution and abundance with the help of Aborigines."}, {"description": "Although the Southern Marsupial Mole was probably known by aborigines for thousands of years, the first specimen examined by the scientific community was collected in 1888. Stockman W. Coulthard made the discovery on Idracowra Pastoral Lease in the Northern Territory by following some unusual prints that lead him to the animal lying under a tussock. Not knowing what to do with the strange creature, he wrapped it in a kerosene soaked rag, placed it in a revolver cartridge box and forwarded it to E.C. Stirling, the Director of the South Australian Museum. Due to the poor transportation conditions of the time, the specimen reached its destination in a badly decomposed state. Hence, Stirling was unable to find any evidence of the pouch or epipubic bones and decided the creature was not a marsupial.19th century scientists believed that marsupials and eutherians had evolved from the same primitive ancestor and were looking for a living specimen that would act as the missing link. Because the marsupial mole closely resembled the golden moles of Africa, some scientists concluded that the two were related and that they had found the proof. This is of course not the case, as it became obvious by examining better preserved specimens that had a marsupial pouch."}, {"description": "The habitat of the Southern Marsupial Mole is not well known, and is generally based on scattered records. It has been often recorded in sandy dunes or flats, usually where spinifex is present. Its habitat seems to be restricted to areas where the sand is soft, as it cannot tunnel through harder materials. Although little is known about its exact distribution, sightings, aboriginal informants and museum records indicate that it lives in the central sandy desert regions of Western Australia, northern South Australia and the Northern Territory. Recent studies indicate that its habitat also includes Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts."}, {"description": "Due to the lack of any field studies regarding the marsupial moles, there is little known about their behavior. Observations of captive animals are limited since most of the moles do not survive more than a little over a month after capture. Surface behaviorIt sometimes wanders above the surface where traces of several animals have been found. While most evidence indicates that it does this seldom and moves just a few meters before burrowing back underground, on some occasions multiple tracks were found suggesting that one or more animals have moved above ground for several hours. According to Aboriginal sources, marsupial moles may surface at any time of day, but seem to prefer to do so after rain and in the cooler season.Captive animals have been observed to feed above ground and then return underground to sleep. Occasionally it has been recorded to suddenly \"faint\" on the surface without waking up for several hours until disturbed.Above the ground it moves in a sinuous fashion, using its powerful forelimbs to haul the body over the surface and its hind limbs to push forward. The forelimbs are extended forward in unison with the opposite hind limb. Moles move about the surface with frantic haste but little speed, as one observer once likened it to a \"Volkswagen Beetle heaving its way through the sand\". Burrowing behaviorWhile burrowing, the Southern Marsupial Mole does not make permanent tunnels, but the sand caves in and tunnels back-fill as the animal moves along. For this reason its burrowing style has been compared to \"swimming through the sand\u201d\". The only way its tunnels can be identified is as a small oval shape of lose sand. Although it spends most of its active time 20-100 cm below the surface, tunneling horizontally or at shallow angles, it sometimes for no apparent reason turns suddenly and burrows vertically to depths of up to 2.5 meters.Although most food sources are likely to occur at depths of approximately 50 cm from the surface, the temperature of these environments varies greatly from less than 15\u00b0C during winter to over 35\u00b0C during summer. While one of the captive moles was observed shivering when the temperature dropped under 16\u00b0C, it seems probable that moles can select the temperature of their environment by burrowing at different depths. DietLittle is known about the Southern Marsupial Mole's diet, and all information is based on the gut content of preserved animals and on observations made on captive specimens. All evidence seems to suggest that the mole is mainly insectivorous, preferring insect eggs, larvae and pupae to the adults. Based on observations made on captive animals, it seems that one of the favorite food choices was beetle larvae, especially Scarabaeidae. Because burrowing requires high energy expenditure it seems unlikely that the mole searches for its food in this prey impoverished environment, and suggests that it probably feeds within nests. It has been also recorded to eat adult insects, seeds and lizards. Below the desert sands of Australia, the marsupial mole searches for burrowing insects and small reptiles. Instead of building a tunnel, it \"swims\" through the ground, allowing the sand to collapse behind it. Social behaviorThere is little known about the social and reproductive behavior of these animals, but all evidence seems to suggest that it leads a solitary life. There are no traces of large burrows where more than one individual might meet and communicate. Although it is not known how the male locates the female, it is assumed that they do so using their highly developed olfactory sense.The fact that the middle ear seems to be morphologically suited for capturing low frequency sounds, and that moles produce high pitched vocalizations when handled, indicates that this kind of sound that propagates more easily underground may be used as a form of communication."}, {"description": "The Southern Marsupial Mole (Notoryctes typhlops) is a mole-like marsupial found in the desert of southwest Australia. It is extremely adapted to a burrowing way of life. It has large, shovel-like forepaws and silky fur, which helps it move easily. The Southern Marsupial Mole also lacks complete eyes as it has little need for them. It feeds on earthworms and larvae."}]}

Its eye has a diameter of only 1mm and it is buried beneath fur and has a cellular lens. The organization of the retina is quite similar to that of a typical mammal. It has been determined that there are about 2000 ganglion cells and the optic nerve is roughly 50 \u03bcm with 3000 axons. Roughly 15% of these axons are myelinated. The photoreceptors are not the normal rod-like or cone-like shape that you would expect to see. Instead they all have one uniform shape with three distinct features: The receptors are short along the radial axis The inner and outer segments are similar in length The outer segments appear to be significantly degenerated Studies have shown that T. europaea does have photopic vision, contrary to popular belief that all moles are blind. Two cone opsins have been found in the eyes of T. europaea but their function is still under investigation. In a study of the mole eyes it was found that Talpa withdraws when exposed to a flashlight and it can also perform light/dark discrimination tasks. The cone cells in the eye are unlikely to provide high-resolution vision but they could allow a detection of movement and some hue discrimination. It is suggested that in subterranean mammals vision is used to detect predators that have broken into the tunnels."}, {"description": "In the Talpa europaea there are several unique changes in ossification sequence in the postcranial elements. Many of the shifts are seen in the vertebral column, specifically the cervical and thoracic regions. The shifts allow the mole to have a more stabilized body axis and cervical region after they are born.After a mole is born and begins to develop it will begin to crawl around and dig. As a result of the constant digging action, elements of the arm and hand that are associated with those movements will begin to ossify. Some elements in the hands of the Talpa, formally described as distal phalanges, are actually the first to ossify. These elements build up a groove for the distal phalanges but ultimately do not fuse with them. These bony elements develop directly, meaning they do not have any cartilaginous precursors. The extra-calcified elements are created from small, calcified particles that are found in the fibrous part of the flexor digitorum profundus. The particles then fuse later in life to form the solid element of the hand. Additionally, the sesamoid bone in the mole, sensu strictu, is a bone that develops within a tendon. It does have a chondrified precursor and it assists the tendon in transmitting force."}, {"description": "The mole has only one relatively short breeding season that occurs in the spring. (From June to January the mole is sexually inactive.) Mating occurs over a span of a few weeks in March and April, followed by a gestation period of 4\u20135 weeks. Most births will occur at the end of April or at the beginning of May. The litter size ranges from 2\u20137. There is a lactation period that follows, where the young remain at their mothers' nest for 4\u20135 weeks but at the end of June the young are usually required to leave the tunnels."}, {"description": "In mammals the cues for hearing are usually based on inter-aural intensity differences, which occur as a result of the diffraction of a progressive sound wave by the head and pinna. They could also be based on inter-aural time differences that are present because of the distance between their two ears. Moles have no pinna so they are thought to hear at low frequencies. In addition to this, their inner ear is unusual for that of a mammal due to the large trabeculation of the posterior ventral skull between the ears. The tympana of the ear lays almost horizontal and the manubrial tips are separated by a distance of 8\u00a0mm. The results of several studies confirms that there is good transmission through European mole's head for a range of low frequencies. Because of this it is expected that there will be acoustic interaction at each tympanic membrane. The results of the study also suggest that the ears of this mole act as balanced, pressure-difference receivers. This system has never been suggested for a mammal in the past, but other reptiles, amphibia, birds, and crickets have been shown to have a direct air pathway between the tympana."}, {"description": "While moles are typically found in tunnel systems, the European mole is not exclusively an underground dweller. In the spring and early summer when the young moles leave their mothers' burrows they must find new territory. This forces them to leave their burrow and they can either make new tunnel systems or enter existing systems. In the summer time, however, they will likely burrow much more superficially. The superficial burrowing could be due in part to the soil that is much harder, which makes burrowing a greater challenge.T. europaea have also been found to spend a lot of time at the sides of drainage lines and streams but do not inhabit flooded or dry soils. However, dry areas do become important when their normal habitats become flooded. Factors such as the type of soil, vegetation present, and altitude have no effect on the areas that moles choose to inhabit. The one factor that does greatly influence the mole population in a specific area is the abundance of earthworms. One would expect for the earthworm population to decrease as the moles feed, however no research has shown this to be true."}, {"description": "One common thought of moles is that they typically consume their own weight in food every 24 hours but this is an exaggeration. Studies have been performed that show moles actually eat about half of their body weight in food each day. When in captivity, moles will eat a wide variety of food items including liver, mice, mealworms, shrews and maggots. However, they always tend to prefer earthworms to all other options."}, {"description": "The variance of morphology between species is very important to paleontologists as it can help define a fossil species. Unlike other characteristics that do not fossilize, like color and karyotype, dentition can be studied as it fossilizes well and varies from species to species. Studying dentition can be very beneficial in recognizing the differences between fossils and subsequently being able to classify them.The Roman mole, Talpa romana, was once considered a subspecies of the European mole as they are of similar size. The only obvious difference between the two is that the Roman mole has skin-covered eyes and it also has a caecoid pelvis, whereas T. europaea has a europoid pelvis. Although similar in body, the dentition of T. romana is obviously larger in size than that of the European mole. Both the length of the tooth row and the individual elements are larger. Moreover, the mesotyle of the upper molars is generally divided. The dentition of Talpa europaea is small and the length of M1-M3 is less than 19% of the length of the condyle base. This mole also has relatively small molars for its size."}, {"description": "The European mole (Talpa europaea) is a mammal of the order Soricomorpha. It is also known as the common mole and the northern mole.Talpa europaea, nomen.atThis mole lives in an underground tunnel system, which it constantly extends. It uses these tunnels to hunt its prey. Under normal conditions the displaced earth is pushed to the surface, resulting in the characteristic molehills. It feeds mainly on earthworms, but also on insects, centipedes and even mice and shrews. Its saliva contains toxins which paralyze earthworms in particular.It has a cylindrical body and is around 12\u00a0cm (5\u00a0inches) long. Females are typically smaller than males. The eyes are small and hidden behind fur, while the ears are just small ridges in the skin. The fur is usually dark grey, but the actual range of colors is larger, as due to the subterranean habits there is no disadvantage in having off-colored fur. European moles with white, light grey, tan, taupe, and black fur have all been reported."}]}

There is diurnal movement of 2 to 10 miles (3\u201316\u00a0km) from shrub cover in day to open foraging areas at night. Home range area varies with habitat and habitat quality. Home ranges of 0.4 to 1.2 square miles (1\u20133\u00a0km2) have been reported in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) communities of northern Utah.Black-tailed jackrabbit require shrubs or small conifers for hiding, nesting, and thermal cover, and grassy areas for night feeding. A shrub-grassland mosaic or widely spaced shrubs interspersed with herbs provides hiding cover while providing feeding opportunities. Small shrubs do not provide adequate cover. In the Snake River Birds of Prey Study Area in southwestern Idaho, black-tailed jackrabbit was more frequent on sites dominated by big sagebrush or black greasewood than on sites dominated by the smaller shrubs winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) or shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia). Black-tailed jackrabbit does not habitually use a burrow, although it has occasionally been observed using abandoned burrows for escape and thermal cover."}, {"description": "Black-tailed jackrabbit is an important prey species for many raptors and carnivorous mammals. The black-tailed jackrabbit and Townsend's ground squirrel (Spermophilus townsendii) are the two most important prey species on the Snake River Birds of Prey Study Area. Hawks preying on black-tailed jackrabbit include the ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), Swainson's hawk (B. swainsoni), and red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis).Janes, Stewart W.

ISBN 0323140130 The black-tailed jackrabbit is the primary prey of Swainson's, red-tailed, and ferruginous hawks on Idaho and Utah sites. Other raptors consuming black-tailed jackrabbit include the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). There is a significant correlation between golden eagle and black-tailed jackrabbit reproduction patterns. In Colorado and southeastern Wyoming, black-tailed jackrabbit constitute 9% of nesting bald eagles' diet. Jackrabbits (Lepus spp.) and cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) combined form 9% of the diet of bald eagles wintering on National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico.Grubb, Teryl G.; Kennedy, Charles E.

In many areas, black-tailed jackrabbit is the primary item in coyote diets. It is locally and regionally important to other mammalian predators. One study found that jackrabbits (Lepus spp.) made up 45% of the bobcat diet in Utah and Nevada. Another Utah\u2013Nevada study found that jackrabbits were the fourth most commonly consumed prey of mountain lion.Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) prey on black-tailed jackrabbit young. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) may also capture young."}, {"description": "The black-tailed jackrabbit occupies plant communities with a mixture of shrubs, grasses, and forbs.

Diseases affecting the black-tailed jackrabbit in the West are tularemia, equine encephalitis, brucellosis, Q fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Ticks are vectors for tularemia, and infected ticks have been found on jackrabbits in the West. Jackrabbits infected with tularemia die very quickly.Whitaker, John O., Jr.; Hamilton, William J., Jr.. 1998. Mammals of the Eastern United States. Cornell University Press. 189-92. ISBN 0-8014-3475-0The high prevalence of disease and parasites in wild jackrabbits affects human predation. Many hunters will not collect the jackrabbits they shoot, and those who do are well advised to wear gloves while handling carcasses and to cook the meat thoroughly to avoid contracting tularemia. Most hunting of jackrabbits is done for pest control or sport."}, {"description": "Male black-tailed jackrabbit reach sexual maturity at about 7 months of age. Females usually breed in the spring of their second year, although females born in spring or early summer may breed in their first year. Ovulation is induced by copulation. The breeding season is variable depending upon latitude and environmental factors. In the northern part of its range in Idaho, black-tailed jackrabbit breeds from February through May. In Utah, black-tailed jackrabbit breed from January through July, with over 75% of females pregnant by April. The Kansas breeding season extends from January to August. Breeding in warm climates continues nearly year-round. Two peak breeding seasons corresponding to rainfall patterns and growth of young vegetation occur in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. In Arizona, for example, breeding peaks during winter (January\u2013March) rains and again during June monsoons.The gestation period ranges from 41 to 47 days. More litters are born in warm climates: the number of litters born each year ranges from two per year in Idaho to seven in Arizona. Litter sizes are largest in the northern portions of black-tailed jackrabbit's range and decrease toward the south. Average litter size has been reported at 4.9 in Idaho, 3.8 in Utah, and 2.2 in Arizona.Female black-tailed jackrabbit do not prepare an elaborate nest. They give birth in shallow excavations called forms that are no more than a few centimeters deep. Females may line forms with hair prior to giving birth, but some drop litters in existing depressions on the ground with no further preparation. Young are borne fully furred with eyes open, and are mobile within minutes of birth. Females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing. Ages of weaning and dispersal are unclear since the young are well camouflaged and rarely observed in the field. Captive black-tailed jackrabbit are fully weaned by 8 weeks. The young stay together for at least a week after leaving the form."}, {"description": "The black-tailed jackrabbit diet is composed of shrubs, small trees, grasses, and forbs. Throughout the course of a year, black-tailed jackrabbit feed on most if not all of the important plant species in a community. Growth stage and moisture content of plants may influence selection more than species. Shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets, while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer. This pattern varies with climate: herbaceous plants are grazed during greenup periods while the plants are in prereproductive to early reproductive stages, and shrubs are utilized more in dry seasons. Shrubs are browsed throughout the year, however. Most of a jackrabbit's (Lepus spp.) body water is replaced by foraging water-rich vegetation.Vorhies, Charles T.; Taylor, Walter P. (1933). \"The life histories and ecology of jack rabbits, Lepus alleni and Lepus californicus ssp., in relation to grazing in Arizona\". Technical Bulletin No. 49. Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona, Agricultural Experiment Station Jackrabbit require a plant's water weight to be at least five times its dry weight in order to meet daily water intake requirements. Therefore, black-tailed jackrabbits switch to phreatophyte (deep-rooted) shrubs when herbaceous vegetation is recovering from their foraging.Plant species used by black-tailed jackrabbit are well documented for desert regions. Forage use in other regions is less well known. However, black-tailed jackrabbit browse Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) seedlings, and oak (Quercus spp.) seedlings and sprouts. Great BasinIn Great Basin, big sagebrush is a primary forage species and is used throughout the year; in southern Idaho it forms 16\u201321% of the black-tailed jackrabbit summer diet. Rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), spiny hopsage (Gray spinosa), and black greasewood are also browsed. Four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) is heavily used in western Nevada. In Butte County, Idaho, winterfat comprises 41% of black-tailed jackrabbits' annual diet. Grasses comprise 14% of the diet, with most grass consumption in March and April. Russian thistle (Salsola kali) is an important forb diet item. Needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata) and Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides) are preferred grasses. Other preferred native grasses include Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda) and bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Where available, crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum and Agropyron cristatum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) are highly preferred. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) use is variable: it comprises 45% of the April diet on two southern Idaho sites, but black-tailed jackrabbit on an eastern Washington site do not use it. Warm desertIn warm desert, mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) are principal browse species.Mares, M. A.; Hulse, A. C. (1977). \"Patterns of some vertebrate communities in creosote bush deserts\", pp. 209\u2013226 in: Mabry, T. J.; Hunziker, J. H.; DiFeo, D. R., Jr. (eds.)

ISBN 0879332824 Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and Yucca spp. are also used. In honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) communities in New Mexico, overall black-tailed jackrabbit diet was 47% shrubs, 22% grasses, and 31% forbs. Black grama (Bouteloua spp.), dropseed (Sporobolus spp.), fluffgrass (Erioneuron pulchellum), and threeawns (Aristida spp.) are the most commonly grazed grasses. Leather croton (Croton pottsii), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), desert marigold (Baileya multiradiata), wooly paperflower (Psilostrophe tagetina), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.) are important forbs, although many forb species are grazed. Opuntia spp., saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), and other cacti are used throughout the year but are especially important in dry seasons as a source of moisture."}, {"description": "Like other jackrabbits, the blacktail has distinctive long ears, and the long, powerful rear legs characteristic of hares. Reaching a length of about 2 ft, and a weight from 3 to, the black-tailed jackrabbit is the third largest North American hare, after the antelope jackrabbit and the white-tailed jackrabbit. The black-tailed jackrabbit's dorsal fur is agouti (dark buff peppered with black), and its undersides and the insides of its legs are creamy white. The ears are black-tipped on the outer surface, and unpigmented inside. The ventral surface of the tail is grey to white, and the black dorsal surface of the tail continues up the spine for a few inches to form a short, black stripe. The females are larger than males, with no other significant differences.Big Bend National Park Black-tailed Jackrabbit, US National Park Service"}, {"description": "The black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), also known as the American desert hare, is a common hare of the western United States and Mexico, where it is found at elevations from sea level to up to 10000 ft. Reaching a length of about 2 ft, and a weight from 3 to, the black-tailed jackrabbit is the third largest North American hare, after the antelope jackrabbit and the white-tailed jackrabbit. The black-tailed jackrabbits occupy mixed shrub-grassland terrains. Their breeding depends on the location; it typically peaks in spring, but may continue all year round in warm climates. Young are born fully furred with eyes open; they are well camouflaged and are mobile within minutes of birth, thus females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing. The average litter size is around four, but may be as low as two and as high as seven in warm regions.The black-tailed jackrabbit does not migrate or hibernate during winter and uses the same habitat of 0.4 to 1.2 square miles (1\u20133\u00a0km2) year-round. Its diet is composed of various shrubs, small trees, grasses and forbs. Shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets, while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer, but the pattern and plant species vary with climate. Black-tailed jackrabbit is an important prey species for raptors and carnivorous mammals, such as eagles, hawks, owls, coyotes, foxes, and wild cats. The rabbits host many ectoparasites including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites; for this reason, hunters often avoid collecting them."}]}

Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to 9 animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000 Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan has intensified its raccoon dog culling since the 1970s, averaging 4,529 kills annually between 1990 and 1998. Harvests have since decreased. Fur useWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur. Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from Amur and northern Manchuria coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.Fur: a practical treatise by Max Bachrach, 3rd ed. published by New York : Prentice-Hall, 1953 When raised in captivity, raccoon dogs can produce 100\u00a0grams of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of goats.In the Japanese islands, the natives employed raccoon dog skin to make bellows, and also to decorate their drums and for winter head-gear. Russian trade in raccoon dogs was quite developed in the Primorye and Ussuri areas in the 1880s. The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during the 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260\u2013300,000, of which it was once estimated that 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5\u20136,000. 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955. After the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30\u201370,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56 thousand, 6,500 came from Belorussia, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania and Krasnodar, 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, Novogrod, Smolensk, Yaroslavl, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Dagestan. Less than 1000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: the length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.Captive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the Far East, with 15 state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in the Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practise lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as silver foxes, which were more valuable. An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5 million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas FUN FUR?. A report on the Chinese fur industry The raccoon dog comprises 11% of all animals hunted in Japan.Quality of the Environment in Japan 1995 [MOE] Twenty percent of domestically produced fur in Russia is from the raccoon dog.[1] Misrepresentation as artificial furIn several widely publicized incidents, clothing advertised and sold as having synthetic faux fur, were documented as actually containing real fur from raccoon dogs.In late 2006, MSNBC reported Macy's had pulled from its shelves and its website two styles of Sean John hooded jackets, originally advertised as featuring faux fur, after an investigation concluded garments were actually made from raccoon dog.Sean John jackets were made with dog fur (December 22, 2006) MSNBC. Retrieved 2008-06-01. Sean Combs, the label's founder, said he had been unaware of the material, but as soon as he knew about it, he had his clothing line stop using the material.On 24 April 2008, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) filed a false advertising complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission alleging at least 20 retailers in the U.S. have been mislabeling raccoon dog fur. They assert 70% of fur garments they tested were raccoon dog but were mislabeled as faux fur, coyote, rabbit, or other animals.HSUS Files New Fur False Advertising Complaint with the Federal Trade Commission In December 2009 Lord & Taylor announced new regulations banning the sale of raccoon dog fur in its stores.On 19 March 2013, three U.S. retailers settled lawsuits with the U.S. government following an investigation which confirmed they had been selling raccoon dog fur, but labeling it as fake fur. Neiman Marcus, DrJays.com and Eminent (Revolve Clothing) reached settlements with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that do not incur financial penalties unless they mislabel the fur again.http://www.cnbc.com/id/100573170http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/faux-faux-fur-kerfuffle-nieman-marcusOn 19 September 2014, The Humane Society of the United States announced Kohls has been selling faux fur that was actually Raccoon dog fur.https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=6595"}, {"description": "Introduced rangeFrom 1928\u20131958, 10,000 raccoon dogs of the N. p. ussuriensis subspecies were introduced in 76 districts, territories and republics of the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve their fur quality. Primor'e was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted on islands in the Sea of Japan. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into Altai, the northern Caucasus, Armenia, Kirgizia, Tatarstan, Kalinin, Penza and Orenburg regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into Leningradsky, Murmansk, Novosibirsk and Bashkortostan. Raccoon dogs in Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Trans-Baikaliya and Altai did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, Middle Asia and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the Baltic states, European Russia (particularly in Kalinin, Novgorod, Pskov and Smolensk regions), in central Russia (Moscow, Yaroslavl, Vologda, Gorkiy, Vladimir, Ryazan Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the black soil belt (Voronezh, Tambov and Kursk), the lower Volga Region and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and Dagestan. In Ukraine, the greatest numbers of raccoon dogs were established in Poltava, Kherson and Lugansk.In 1948, 35 raccoon dogs were introduced into Latvia. The population increased rapidly. In 1960, Latvia officially reported a total of 4,210 raccoon dog were hunted.Miervaldis Bu\u0161s, J\u0101nis Vanags \"Latvijas Me\u017ei\" 1987. Latvia.

Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. In response, Denmark set a goal of zero breeding raccoon dogs by 2015."}, {"description": "Wolves are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In Tartarstan, wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. Red foxes will kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death. Both foxes and Eurasian badgers compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. Eurasian lynxes rarely attack them, due to their low numbers. Birds of prey known to prey on raccoon dogs include golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, goshawks and eagle owls."}, {"description": "Raccoon dog skulls greatly resemble those of South American foxes particularly crab-eating foxes, though genetic studies reveal they are not closely related.Kauhala K. & Saeki M.

Their skulls are small, but sturdily built and moderately elongated, with narrow zygomatic arches. The projections of the skull are well developed, the sagittal crest being particularly prominent in old animals. In reflection of their omnivorous diets, raccoon dogs have small and weak canines and carnassials, flat molars and relatively long intestines (1.5\u20132 times longer than other canids). They have long torsos and short legs. Total lengths can range from 45 to. The tail, at 12 to long, is short, amounting to less than 1/3 of the animal's total length and hangs below the tarsal joints without touching the ground. The ears are short, and protrude only slightly from the fur.

Six species of fleas are known to be carried by them, including Chaetopsylla trichosa, C. globiceps, Paraceras melis, Ctenocephalides felis, C. canis and Pulex irritans. Ticks include Dermacentor pictus, Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus, I. crenulatus and Acarus siro.

Canine distemper occurs in raccoon dogs inhabiting the northern Caucasus. Captive raccoon dogs in Soviet state animal farms were recorded to carry paratyphoid, anthrax and tuberculosis. Although they can be infected with mange, it does not pose a significant threat to their populations as it does with foxes."}, {"description": "Reproduction and developmentThe mating season begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are monogamous animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates. Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and will last 6\u20139 minutes on average. Estrus lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females will mate up to five times. Females will enter estrus again after 20\u201324\u00a0days, even when pregnant. The gestation period lasts 61\u201370\u00a0days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes on average consist of 6\u20137\u00a0pups, though 15\u201316\u00a0pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups. This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now extensive introduced European range.Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.At birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110\u00a0grams, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking guard hairs. Their eyes open after 9\u201310\u00a0days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316\u00a0days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10\u00a0days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. Lactation lasts for 45\u201360\u00a0days, though pups will begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks or one month. They reach their full growth at the age of 4.5\u00a0months. Pups will leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, will unite in pairs. Sexual maturity is reached at 8\u201310\u00a0months. Their longevity is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137\u00a0years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years. HibernationRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to hibernate. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as Ussuriland and their introduced range, raccoon dogs only hibernate during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320\u00a0cm, and will limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available. DietRaccoon dogs are omnivores that feed on insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, molluscs, carrion and insectivores. Among the rodents targeted by raccoon dogs, voles seem to predominate in swampy areas, but are replaced with gerbils in flatland areas such as Astrakhan. Frogs are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the Voronezh region, they frequently eat fire-bellied toads, while European spadefoot toads are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads which have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p119 They will prey on waterfowl, passerines and migrating birds. Grouse are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of pheasant predation are recorded in the Ussuri territory. Raccoon dogs will eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but will eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young tortoises and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include shrews and hedgehogs and, on rare occasions, moles and desmans. In the Ussuri territory, large moles are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes bulbs, rhizomes, oats, millets, maize, nuts, fruits, berries, grapes, melons, watermelons, pumpkins and tomatoes. In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries, using their curved claws to climb.Raccoon dogs will modify their diets seasonally; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion and faeces, while fruit, insects and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains and vegetables. VocalisationsThey do not bark like foxes, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles (1839) by Charles Hamilton Smith and Sir William Jardine, published by Edinburgh : W.H.

So k\u00f6nnen in Regionen mit geringer Individuenanzahl die Aktionsr\u00e4ume der m\u00e4nnlichen Tiere deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer werden und fast 3\u00a0ha erreichen, bei Weibchen wirkt sich dies dagegen weniger stark aus. M\u00f6glicherweise minimieren damit Muttertiere die Gefahr, von Beutegreifern gestellt zu werden. Trotz der teils schwankenden Revierausdehnungen sind die Streifgebiete der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer in der Karoo deutlich kleiner als bei den Verwandten in der Namib, die bis zu 100\u00a0ha Gr\u00f6\u00dfe erreichen. Die H\u00e4ufigkeit der \u00dcberschneidungen von Revieren bei Individuen des gleichen Geschlechts ist sehr gering, ebenso wie zwischen den beiden Geschlechtern, was auf einen gewissen Grad an Territorialit\u00e4t sowohl bei M\u00e4nnchen als auch Weibchen schlie\u00dfen l\u00e4sst. Generell leben bei den R\u00fcsselspringern M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen in monogamen Paarbeziehungen, welche bis zum Tod eines Partners anhalten k\u00f6nnen. Die gemeinsamen Aktivit\u00e4ten beschr\u00e4nken sich aber weitgehend auf die Zeit kurz vor und w\u00e4hrend der Brunft. Dann bleibt das M\u00e4nnchen in der N\u00e4he des Weibchens, folgt ihr und \u00fcberlagert mit seinen Duftmarken die seiner Partnerin. M\u00e4nnchen verteidigen in dieser Phase auch die Reviere ihrer Lebensgef\u00e4hrtin gegen\u00fcber anderen paarig lebenden Artgenossen. Durch dieses teils zeitlich beschr\u00e4nkte Verhalten sind die monogamen Paarbindungen beim Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer eher locker, da M\u00e4nnchen zum Teil auch zwei oder mehr Weibchen besuchen. Dieser Fall tritt haupts\u00e4chlich dann ein, wenn weibliche Tiere ihren Partner verloren haben. In der Regel kehrt das gebundene M\u00e4nnchen aber einige Zeit sp\u00e4ter in das eigene Streifgebiet zur\u00fcck, zumeist dann, wenn ein ungebundenes M\u00e4nnchen ebenfalls dem partnerlosen Weibchen folgt. Der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer nutzt verschiedene Unterschl\u00fcpfe, die in den einzelnen Aktionsr\u00e4umen verteilt sind. Die Verstecke bestehen aus Felsspalten oder Fels\u00fcberh\u00e4ngen, liegen unter Gesteinsbrocken und unter Geb\u00fcschen, die Eing\u00e4nge sind h\u00e4ufig von Vegetation bedeckt. Es werden aber keine besonderen Nester in den Unterschl\u00fcpfen angelegt. Ern\u00e4hrungDer Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer ist ein Allesfresser, der sowohl Insekten als auch pflanzliches Material vertilgt. Insgesamt gesehen umfasst die Nahrung nach Untersuchungen in der Karoo durchschnittlich 46,5 % Insekten, 48,4 % entfallen auf Pflanzen, die restlichen 5 % stellen Samen dar. Auff\u00e4llig ist, dass Weibchen in der Regel mehr Insekten fressen als M\u00e4nnchen, was m\u00f6glicherweise mit dem h\u00f6heren Energieverbrauch und damit dem gr\u00f6\u00dferen Bedarf an proteinreicherer Nahrung w\u00e4hrend der Tr\u00e4chtigkeit und Stillphase der Jungtiere zusammenh\u00e4ngt. Es bestehen aber regionale und jahreszeitliche Unterschiede. In den westlichen Gebieten der Sukkulenten-Karoo ist der Anteil an Insekten und Pflanzen \u00fcber das Jahr gesehen mehr oder weniger gleich. In den \u00f6stlicheren Verbreitungsgebieten, die durch zwei Regenzeiten gepr\u00e4gt sind, gibt es st\u00e4rkere Variationen. Der j\u00e4hrliche Anteil an Insekten betr\u00e4gt hier 63 %, der an Pflanzen 36,7 %. Im Sommer werden dabei bis zu 77,4 % Insekten vertilgt, in Einzelf\u00e4llen sogar bis zu 88 %, im Winter dagegen nur 42,5 %. In dieser Jahreszeit, die im Gegensatz zu den westlichen Arealen trocken ist, steigt der Verbrauch von Pflanzen, da Insekten deutlich seltener vorkommen. Hervorgehoben werden muss, dass eine h\u00e4ufige Anwesenheit von Insekten nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig den Konsum dieser beim Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer erh\u00f6ht. FortpflanzungDie Fortpflanzung erfolgt \u00fcber das gesamte Jahr, der \u00d6strus der Weibchen setzt etwa alle 10 Wochen ein. Tr\u00e4chtige Weibchen k\u00f6nnen h\u00e4ufig im Sommer (September bis Februar) beobachtet werden, w\u00e4hrend die Anzahl im fr\u00fchen Winter von M\u00e4rz bis Juli stark zur\u00fcckgeht. Die durchschnittliche Fortpflanzungsdauer betr\u00e4gt laut Untersuchungen im Goegap Nature Reserve somit f\u00fcr jedes Tier insgesamt rund acht Monate im Jahr, w\u00e4hrend derer Weibchen insgesamt zwei bis drei Mal Nachwuchs bekommen. Die monogame Lebensweise f\u00fchrt dazu, dass das M\u00e4nnchen seine Partnerin vor allem vor und w\u00e4hrend der Brunft begleitet. Kurz vor Eintritt des \u00d6strus reiben die weiblichen Tiere ihre Duftdr\u00fcse des ano-genitalen Bereiches am Boden und setzen so ein Sekret ab, dass nur kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter von dem eigenen Duftmarken des M\u00e4nnchens \u00fcberdeckt wird, was die bestehende Partnerschaft anzeigt. Die Tragzeit dauert durchschnittlich 56 Tage, w\u00e4hrend dieser Zeit nimmt das Gewicht des Weibchens um bis zu 20\u00a0g zu \u2013 ein untersuchtes Individuum wog kurz vor der Geburt 64,3\u00a0g \u2013, was in etwa der H\u00e4lfte des Normalgewichtes des Muttertieres entspricht. danach bringt das Weibchen meist eins bis zwei Jungtiere zur Welt. In menschlicher Obhut konnte sehr selten auch die Geburt von drei Jungen beobachtet werden. Die Geburt erfolgt in einem Unterschlupf, der die Temperaturgegens\u00e4tze zwischen Tag und Nacht reguliert. Der Bau der Nachkommen ist abgetrennt von dem des m\u00e4nnlichen oder weiblichen Elterntiers, ein spezielles Nest wird in diesem ebenfalls nicht eingerichtet. Die Neugeborenen sind bei der Geburt schon weit entwickelt, sie besitzen ein weiches Fell und haben ge\u00f6ffnete Augen. Ihr Gewicht liegt bei rund 9\u00a0g. W\u00e4hrend der Aufzucht erfolgt keine direkte Betreuung des Nachwuchses durch das Vatertier, das Muttertier besucht die Jungen nur unregelm\u00e4\u00dfig zum Stillen, durchschnittlich einmal t\u00e4glich. Die Saugphase ist relativ kurz und dauert etwa zwei bis drei Wochen. Bereits am f\u00fcnften Tag nehmen die Jungtiere Insektennahrung zu sich. Diese wird vom Muttertier anf\u00e4nglich gesammelt und vorgekaut. Zum Ende der Saugphase beginnen die Jungen auch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Ausfl\u00fcge zu unternehmen, die bis zu 240\u00a0m weit reichen. Nach rund sechs Wochen sind sie geschlechtsreif und unabh\u00e4ngig. Aufgrund des kurzen Sexualzyklusses kann das das Weibchen noch w\u00e4hrend der Aufzucht der Jungen bereits neuen Nachwuchs austragen. Die Lebenserwartung in freier Natur ist unbekannt, es wird aber davon ausgegangen, dass sie \u00e4hnlich wie bei den nahe verwandten Elefantenspitzm\u00e4usen bei ein bis zwei Jahren liegt. In menschlicher Obhut gehaltene Tiere wurden bis zu acht Jahren und acht Monaten alt. Fressfeinde und ParasitenZu den bedeutendsten Fressfeinden geh\u00f6rt die Schleiereule, in deren Gew\u00f6llen Reste des Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringers nachgewiesen wurden. Bei Gefahr rennt ein Tier von Busch zu Busch und versteckt sich gegebenenfalls in einem Unterschlupf. Als \u00e4u\u00dfere Parasiten treten vor allem Fl\u00f6he auf."}, {"description": "Der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer ist eine Art aus der Gattung Macroscelides. Dieser Gattung werden heute insgesamt drei Arten zugewiesen, wobei zwei Arten erst nach dem Jahr 2010 aufgestellt wurden. Macroscelides bildet einen Teil der Familie der R\u00fcsselspringer (Macroscelididae) innerhalb der gleichnamigen Ordnung der R\u00fcsselspringer (Macroscelidea). Diese Gruppe kleinerer, nur in Afrika heimischer S\u00e4ugetiere gliedert sich in zwei Unterfamilien. Zu den Rhynchocyoninae werden nur die R\u00fcsselh\u00fcndchen (Rhynchocyon) verwiesen, sie sind dadurch monotypisch. Die R\u00fcsselh\u00fcndchen, die gleichzeitig die gr\u00f6\u00dften Vertreter der R\u00fcsselspringer sind, bewohnen \u00fcberwiegend bewaldete Habitate. Die Macroscelidinae bilden die zweite Unterfamilie, ihr geh\u00f6ren die Elefantenspitzm\u00e4use (Elephantulus), die R\u00fcsselratte (Petrodromus) und die Arten der Gattung Macroscelides an. Alle Vertreter der Macroscelidinae sind an deutlich trockenere Offenlandschaften bis teils w\u00fcstenartige Regionen angepasst. Molekulargenetischen Untersuchungen ergaben ein n\u00e4heres Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnis von Macroscelides mit Petrodromus. Die beiden Unterfamilien trennten sich im Oberen Oligoz\u00e4n vor etwa 26 Millionen Jahren von der Linie der gemeinsamen Vorfahren ab, eine st\u00e4rkere Diversifizierung der Macroscelidinae fand ab dem Mittleren Mioz\u00e4n vor rund 13,9 Millionen Jahren statt. George Shaw Die taxonomische Geschichte der Gattung Macroscelides ist komplex. In der ersten H\u00e4lfte des 20. Jahrhunderts war eine Aufteilung der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer in zwei Arten mit bis zu 10 Unterarten im Gebrauch. Neben M. proboscideus galt auch M. melanotis als anerkannte Art. Eine Revision der Gattung im Jahr 1968 erbrachte mit M. proboscideus nur eine g\u00fcltige Art, die zwei Unterarten enthielt. Demnach beschr\u00e4nkte sich M. p. proboscideus auf die Karoo-Gebiete in S\u00fcdafrika, die durch dunklere Landschaftst\u00f6ne und st\u00e4rker von Schatten beeinflusste Areale gekennzeichnet sind. M. p. flavicaudatus bewohnte dagegen die helleren und sonnigeren Regionen der Namib weiter n\u00f6rdlich. Die teils variantenreichen Fellzeichnungen wurden dabei als Anpassung an lokale Habitatbedingungen angesehen. Noch bis zum Beginn des dritten Jahrtausends galt der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer als einzige Art innerhalb der Gattung Macroscelides . Allerdings wurde \u00fcber das Vorkommen und die Anzahl der Unterarten diskutiert. Erst Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts durchgef\u00fchrte molekulargenetische Untersuchungen kombiniert mit Feldforschungen vor Ort erbrachten evidente Hinweise auf eine differenziertere Unterteilung der Gattung. Die genetischen Analysen konnten eine n\u00f6rdliche und eine s\u00fcdliche Population abtrennen, was auch durch die Vorort-Untersuchungen best\u00e4tigt wurde, die eine r\u00e4umliche Trennung der beiden Gruppen ergaben. Aufgrund der ebenfalls nachgewiesenen genetischen Isolation der beiden Gruppen erhoben die beteiligten Forscher im Jahr 2012 die Unterart M. p. flavicaudatus in den Artstatus, womit Macroscelides flavicaudatus neben Macroscelides proboscideus die zweite anerkannte Art der Gattung Macroscelides bildete. Mit Macroscelides micus kam zwei Jahre sp\u00e4ter eine dritte, regional sympatrisch zu M. flavicaudatus auftretende Art hinzu. Aufgrund der Neubewertung von M. p. flavicaudatus als eigenst\u00e4ndige Art werden heute keine Unterarten des Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringers unterschieden.Die wissenschaftlicher Erstbeschreibung des Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringers erfolgte im Jahr 1800 durch George Shaw. Sie erfolgte unter der Artbezeichnung Sorex proboscideus, womit Shaw die Art zu den Rotzahnspitzm\u00e4usen stellte. Als besondere Kennzeichen nannte Shaw die braune Fellfarbe und die auff\u00e4llig lange Nase. Er gab als vermutliches Typusgebiet das Kap der Guten Hoffnung an, was 1951 von Austin Roberts in Roodewal, Oudthoorn, Kapprovinz (heute Westkap) spezifiziert wurde. Der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer ist damit das forschungsgeschichtlich am fr\u00fchesten beschriebene Mitglied der R\u00fcsselspringer."}, {"description": "Verbreitungsgebiet des Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringers (gr\u00fcn) im Vergleich zu den beiden anderen Macroscelides-Arten Der Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringer ist endemisch im s\u00fcdwestlichen Afrika verbreitet. Er lebt im s\u00fcdlichen und westlichen S\u00fcdafrika, im s\u00fcdlichen Namibia und im s\u00fcdwestlichsten Teil von Botswana. Der Lebensraum umfasst trockene Regionen, meist W\u00fcsten und Halbw\u00fcsten, haupts\u00e4chlich die sogenannte Karoo. Hier dominieren vor allem sandige und kiesige Ebenen, die aber h\u00e4ufig relativ dicht mit Grasb\u00fcschel- und Buschvegetation bedeckt sind. Die B\u00fcsche k\u00f6nnen dabei durchaus bis zu 1 m hoch werden. Die Jahresdurchschnittstemperaturen in der Karoo schwanken um 15 bis 19\u00b0C, der j\u00e4hrliche Niederschlag liegt bei 66 bis 200\u00a0mm. Die H\u00f6henverteilung reicht vom Meeresspiegelniveau in der Sukkulenten-Karoo bis zu 1400\u00a0m H\u00f6he in der Nama-Karoo. Die Populationsdichte wird als sehr gering angesehen. Nach Untersuchungen in den Jahren 2005 bis 2007 im Goegap Nature Reserve in S\u00fcdafrika fluktuierte sie zwischen 0,35 und 1,59 Individuen je Hektar. Die beiden anderen Vertreter von Macroscelides haben ein weiter n\u00f6rdlich gelegenes Areal, das weitgehend in der Namib liegt. Dabei trennt ein rund 50 km breiter Korridor im NamibRand-Naturreservat das Verbreitungsgebiet des Kurzohrr\u00fcsselspringers von dem von M. flavicaudatus."}]}

Although there have been marked and well-documented declines in some areas, the species remains widespread, abundant, and apparently stable in other areas. Assessed as Least Concern\". However, the overall greater horseshoe bat population is declining. They are largely uncommon in much of their range. Despite this, they appear to be abundant and widespread in at least parts of south-west Asia and the Caucasus least parts of south-west Asia and the Caucasus. Also in some northwest European countries, there appears to be some stabilisation and/or recovery. Less is known about bat trends in other parts of Europe. It is extinct in Malta. Fragmentation/isolation of habitats, change of management regime of deciduous forests and agricultural areas, loss of insects caused by pesticides, and disturbance and loss of underground habitats and attics are the major threats to the greater horseshoe bat. Deforestation, mostly caused by logging operations and the conversion of land for agricultural and other uses, threatens the species in South Asia.Molur, S., Marimuthu, G., Srinivasulu, C., Mistry, S. Hutson, A. M., Bates, P. J. J., Walker, S., Padmapriya, K. and Binupriya, A. R. 2002. Status of South Asian Chiroptera: Conservation Assessment and Management Plan (C.A.M.P.) Workshop Report. Zoo Outreach Organization/CBSG-South Asia, Coimbatore, India. Status in Britain The species is rare in Britain, confined to just a small number of sites. Its distribution can be found on the National Biodivesity website here. Its breeding sites include Brockley Hall Stables near Bristol, Iford Manor near Bath, and Littledean Hall in the Forest of Dean. Its winter hibernation sites include Banwell Caves and Compton Martin Ochre Mine in the Mendip Hills, Chilmark Quarries in Wiltshire, and Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines near Bath. In Dorset, the species roosts at Bryanston, Creech Grange and in Belle Vue Quarry. The species also occurs at Berry Head in Devon and has a monitored roost site at Woodchester Mansion in Stroud.The species has disappeared from over half of its former range within the United Kingdom, with about 1% of the population surviving. Like all horseshoe bats it is sensitive to disturbance, and is threatened by the use of insecticides and the elimination of beetles by the changing agricultural practices.There are seventeen recorded species of bat in Britain as of recent survey results.The greater horseshoe bat is one of the rarest. There are currently 35 recognised maternity and all-year roosts and 369 hibernation sites. Current estimates range between 4000 and 6600 individuals. Greater Horseshoes have declined for numerous reasons ranging from the use of agrichemicals (Ivermectin in particular) to loss of habitat and redundancy of farming methods. Avermectin kills off insect larvae and thus a decrease in the abundance of food for the Horseshoes, causing them to travel farther and face increased dangers.Habitat loss is primarily due to the lack of established hedgerows and deciduous woodland-pasture ecotones. Modern farming methods have seen the reduction of cattle-grazing and this has impacted the Horseshoes who previously found that dung attracted insects and sustained entomogenous populations, giving their prey a stable population."}, {"description": "Habitat and roosting Pastures, deciduous temperate woodland, Mediterranean and sub-mediterranean shrubland and woodlands are common foraging habitats for this species. In northern parts of its range, the horseshoe uses warm underground sites, both natural and artificial, as summer roosts as well as attics. Where the species occupies buildings, proximity to good foraging areas and underground sites for torpor at various times of year and for winter hibernation as well as the building's own features are important.Hutson A.

The bat require a certain temperature and humidity limit, but thus can vary with age, sex and condition. Horseshoe bats are active throughout the year in the southern parts of their range. Horse bats commonly travel distances of 20\u201330\u00a0km between winter and summer roosts, with longest distance recorded being 180\u00a0km.de Paz, O., Fern\u00e1ndez, R. and Benzal, J. 1986. \" El annilamiento de qir\u00f3pteros en el centro de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica durante el periodo 1977-1986 \". Central de Ecologia 30: 113-138. Horseshoes bats also live in montane forests among the mountains and valleys of the Himalaya in South Asia and roosts in caves, old temples, old and ruined buildings in tight clusters. Diet and huntingThe species feeds preferentially on lepidoptera (moths), making up around 41% of the diet - in particular the noctuidae species.,Bat Conservation Trust Greater Horseshoe bat Species information leaflet Coleoptera (beetles) constitute around 33% of the diet, of which dung beetles are often taken. Aphodius rufipes is one such dung beetle forming an especially important part of its diet. Cow pats are part of its life cycle, acting as a food source and habitat for the larvae. Up to 100 larvae can be found in a single cow pat. The beetle is most abundant in August when the young bats begin their first feeding flights).Wild Devon The Magazine of the Devon Wildlife Trust, page 14, Winter 2009 edition The remainder of the diet consists of Hymenoptera and Diptera species. Cockchafers also form an important part of its diet.The feeding area from the maternity roost is typically of radius 4\u00a0km, as neither the lactating females or young can travel far. In late August and September the bats feed on cranefly, to fatten up before hibernation. Breeding females depend on beetles from April until June, and moths from June to August.The Greater Horseshoe Bat leaves its roost at dusk. Its flying is made up of slow, fluttering travel with short glides, normally between 0.3 and 6\u00a0metres above the ground. Little hunting is done during wet and windy weather. It hunts in terrain with poor tree cover such as hillsides and cliff faces, and in gardens where it locates insects from a resting place and then intercepts them. The species has the ability to pick food up off the ground while still in flight, and indeed drinks during low-level flight or while hovering. The feeding range of colonies in England is between 8 and 16\u00a0kilometres. Mating and reproductionFemale bats become sexually mature at the age of three years while males are sexually mature at two years.Ransome RD (1995) Earlier Breeding Shortens Life in Female Greater Horseshoe Bats. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 350, 153-161. Some females may not breed until their fifth year.Racey, P. 1982. \"Ecology of Bat Reproduction\". Pp. 57-93 in T. Kruz, ed. Ecology of Bats. New York: Plenum Press. Most matings take place in the fall, however some occur in the spring.Rossiter, S., J. Jones, R. Ransome, E. Barratt. 2000. \"Genetic variation and population structure in the endangered greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrmequinum\". Molecular Ecology, 9: 1131-1135. The reproductive behaviour of this species has been studied in detail. During the mating period, females visit males that are roosting in small caves. The mating system is best described as polygynous, with multiple females visiting males. However, genetic evidence has shown that some female greater horseshoe bats will visit and mate with the same male partner over successive years, indicating monogamy or mate fidelity.Rossiter SJ, Ransome RD, Faulkes CG, Le Comber SL and Jones G (2005) Mate-fidelity and intra-lineage polygyny in greater horseshoe bats. Nature 437, 408-411. Curiously, related females have also been found to share sexual partners, which might serve to increase relatedness and social cohesiveness in the colony. Males vary in their reproductive success but do not tend to show reproductive skew within a year. However, over several years, skew becomes strong due to the repeated success of particular males.Rossiter SJ, Ransome RD, Faulkes CG, Dawson DA and Jones G (2006) Long-term reproductive skew in male greater horseshoe bats. Molecular Ecology 15, 3035-3043.After mating, seminal fluid coagulates in the female\u2019s vulva to form a plug, which probably functions either to prevent subsequent matings by other males,Fenton, M. 1994. Just Bats. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. or to increase the chances that the sperm are retained for successful fertilzation. There is some evidence that females can eject these plugs, suggesting that they may be able to exert some control over fertilizations which take place. Females raise their young in communal maternity roosts, and show strong fidelity to the sites where were themselves were born (so-called natal philopatry). Each season, a female produces one offspring. Most young are born in June or July. When they are seven days old, young can open their eyes and at their third or fourth week they can fly. Young can live the roost their seventh or eighth week."}, {"description": "The greater horseshoe bat ranges from North Africa and southern Europe through south-west Asia, the Caucasus, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Himalayas to south-eastern China, Korea, and Japan.Csorba G.

It preys on vertebrates like frogs and small mammals including voles, mice, moles, rats and squirrels. It also eats bird eggs. Plant matter the skunk eats include blackberries, raspberries, black cherries, blueberries, grains, corn, and nuts. Skunks eat mostly insects and mammals during the spring and summer. During the fall and winter, more plant matter is consumed. In settled areas, skunks also seek human garbage.

Pet owners, particularly those of cats, may experience a skunk finding its way into a garage or basement where pet food is kept. Skunks commonly dig holes in lawns in search of grubs and worms.Skunks are one of the primary predators of the honeybee, relying on their thick fur to protect them from stings.

In contrast, it diverged from the gliding possums much earlier, around 36\u00a0million years ago.

Young leaves are preferred because they have higher concentration of nitrogen and lower concentration of lignocellulose (acid-detergent fibre). Overall, the eucalypt leaves are a poor source of nutrients.Because of its night time activities, a natural predator on the glider is the Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua). It hunts by concentrating in pockets within their relatively large home range until populations of prey are depleted to a level that causes the owl to shift hunting grounds. Other predators include feral cats, which are not native to Australia, being introduced with the arrival of Europeans."}, {"description": "The greater glider is found in southern Queensland, eastern Australia, southeastern New South Wales, and the montane forests of the Victorian central highlands.

A large factor determining habitat choice is the presence of specific species of eucalypt. Distribution levels are higher in regions of montane forest containing Manna Gum (E. viminalis) and Mountain Gum (E. dalrympleana, E. obliqua). Furthermore, the presence of E. cypellocarpa appears to improve the quality of habitat for the greater glider in forests dominated by E. obliqua. Another factor determining population density is elevation. Optimal levels are 845\u00a0m above sea level.

During the day, it spends most of its time denning in hollowed trees, with each animal using up to twenty different dens within its home range. The dens are often lined with leaves and strips of bark. This is why spotlighting has become a popular way of locating members of a population; when a strong light is directed at the eyes of a glider, the observer will see two bright red orbs reflecting back. Within forests, males and females will have home territories and set borders between other members. For males, home territory ranges from 1.4 to while that of females is only 1.3 to. Although home ranges may overlap, the animals remain generally solitary outside of the breeding season, and only rarely interact. In large and small patches of forest, the home territories will respectively be larger and smaller.The gliding posture of the greater glider is unique among marsupials. The forelimbs are folded so that the wrists are tucked under the chin, giving the patagium a triangular outline when outstretched. The animal regularly glides between high trees, and is able to use the tail to assist in steering. They avoid travelling along the ground whenever possible, and are slow and clumsy if forced to do so.Greater gliders do not make any loud sounds, and probably communicate through scent marking. The animal's cloacal glands give it a generally musty smell."}, {"description": "Greater gliders have a head and body about 39 to long, with the females being generally larger than the males. Their body is covered with a shaggy coat of fur that increases their apparent size, and the tail is long and bushy, ranging from 44 to. The head is short, but with a pointed muzzle, and large ears fringed and backed with long fur. Each side of the body bears membranes stretching between the elbow and the ankle, that give the animal the ability to perform controlled glides. This is in contrast to other gliding marsupials (such as the sugar glider) that have gliding membranes stretching from the wrists to the ankles.The feet have strongly recurved claws to grip onto bark or other surfaces. There are five toes on each foot, with the first toe on the hind foot, and the first two toes on the fore foot, being opposable.The fur is soft and up to 60 mm long; the colour is variable within the same populations, ranging from white to brown and charcoal. Body mass varies clinally from about 1600 g in southern Victoria to about 600 g in north Queensland. PhysiologyHeat management in the greater glider is performed by licking extremities and the ventral body surface, with direct evaporation being the main method of the cooling. Furthermore, the glider can use its gliding membranes to reduce heat loss by increasing the layer of insulation at the skin surface. However, the greater glider is not well equipped to handle high ambient temperatures, as it inefficiently uses water for evaporation via salivation even though arboreal habitats are often limited in water accessibility.The greater glider can digest low nutrient foliage, specifically eucalypt leaf matter, which contains a variety of phenolic and terpenoid compounds and a high concentration of lignified fibre. Animals can digest about 50\u201360% of the leaf during its passage through the gut The gut has a specialized caecum that is contains a population of bacteria that ferment food residues that remain undigested in the small intestine. For a population in a eucalypt forest near Maryborough, Queensland, it has been calculated that their daily energy intake is about 1130\u00a0kJ, which is provided by about 45 to of dry matter daily.Mature females will give birth to a single progeny, each year which is typically born in late autumn or early winter. The underdeveloped offspring will then spend the next four months within the pouch of the mother to suckle and develop. It will remain within the security of the pouch until about nine months of age."}, {"description": "The greater glider (Petauroides volans) is a small gliding marsupial found in Australia. It is not closely related to the Petaurus group of gliding marsupials but instead to the lemur-like ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides), with which it shares the subfamily Hemibelideinae.The greater glider is nocturnal and is a solitary herbivore feeding almost exclusively on Eucalyptus leaves and buds. Like its relative the lemur-like ringtail, the greater glider is found in two forms: a sooty brown form, or a grey-to-white form.The greater glider is found in eucalypt forest from Mossman, Queensland, to Daylesford, Victoria."}, {"description": "The breeding season for greater glider is relatively brief, lasting from February to May, with births occurring between April and June. Females have a relatively well-developed pouch, opening towards the forward part of the animal, and containing two teats. Only a single young is born each year.At birth, the young weighs only around 0.27 g, but it does not begin to leave the pouch for about four months, by which time it is already furred and well developed. After leaving the pouch, the mother may carry it about on her back, until it is weaned at about seven months of age. The young are independent at nine months, and reach sexual maturity between 18 months and two years after birth.Greater gliders have been recorded as living for up to fifteen years."}]}

They are poached for ivory and a variety of other products including meat and leather. Human\u2013elephant conflict One of the major instigators of human\u2013wildlife conflict is competition for space. Destruction of forests through logging, encroachment, slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation, and monoculture tree plantations are major threats to the survival of elephants. Human\u2013elephant conflicts occur when elephants raid crops of shifting cultivators in fields, which are scattered over a large area interspersed with forests. Depredation in human settlements is another major area of human\u2013elephant conflict occurring in small forest pockets, encroachments into elephant habitat, and on elephant migration routes. Studies in Sri Lanka indicate that traditional slash-and-burn agriculture creates optimal habitat for elephants by creating a mosaic of successional-stage vegetation. Populations inhabiting small habitat fragments are much more liable to come into conflict with humans.Human-elephant conflict is categorized into: ultimate causes including growing human population, large-scale development projects and poor top-down governance; proximate causes including habitat loss due to deforestation, disruption of elephant migratory routes, expansion of agriculture and illegal encroachment into protected areas. Development such as border fencing along the India-Bangladesh border has become a major impediment to the free movement of elephants.Choudhury, A. U. (2007). Impact of border fence along India \u2013 Bangladesh border on elephant movement. Gajah 26: 27\u201330. In Assam, more than 1,150 humans and 370 elephants died as a result of human-elephant conflict between 1980 and 2003. In India alone, over 400 people are killed by elephants every year, and 0.8 to 1 million hectares are damaged, affecting at least 500,000 families across the country.Rangarajan, M., Desai, A., Sukumar, R., Easa, P.

Report of the Elephant Task Force. Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi. Moreover, elephants are known to destroy crops worth up to US$2\u20133 million annually. This has major impacts on the welfare and livelihoods of local communities, as well as the future conservation of this species. Poaching The demand for ivory as a result of rapid economic development during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in East Asia, led to rampant poaching and the serious decline of elephants in many Asian and African range countries. In Thailand, the illegal trade in live elephants and ivory still flourishes. Although the quantity of worked ivory seen openly for sale has decreased substantially since 2001, Thailand still has one of the largest and most active ivory industries seen anywhere in the world. Tusks from Thai poached elephants also enter the market; between 1992 and 1997 at least 24 male elephants were killed for their tusks.Stiles, D. (2009). The elephant and ivory trade in Thailand. TRAFFIC Southeast Asia, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.Up to the early 1990s, Vietnamese ivory craftsmen used exclusively Asian elephant ivory from Vietnam and neighbouring Lao PDR and Cambodia. Before 1990, there were few tourists and the low demand for worked ivory could be supplied by domestic elephants. Economic liberalization and an increase in tourism raised both local and visitors\u2019 demands for worked ivory, which resulted in heavy poaching. Handling methodsYoung elephants are captured and illegally imported to Thailand from Myanmar for use in the tourism industry; calves are used mainly in amusement parks and are trained to perform various stunts for tourists.The calves are often subjected to a 'breaking in' process, which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured; as a result, two-thirds may perish. Handlers use a technique known as the training crush, in which \"handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to \"break\" the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners\"; moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants' ears and feet."}, {"description": "Carl Linnaeus first described the genus Elephas and an elephant from Ceylon under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758.Linnaei, C.

The Syrian elephant (E. m. asurus), the westernmost and the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant, became extinct around 100 BC. This population, along with the Indian elephant, was considered the best war elephant in antiquity, and was found superior to the smallish North African elephant (Loxodonta africana pharaoensis) used by the armies of Carthage."}, {"description": "At most seasons of the year, Asian elephants are timid and much more ready to flee from a foe than to attack. However, solitary rogues are frequently an exception to this rule, and sometimes make unprovoked attacks on passers-by. Rogue elephants sometimes take up a position near a road, making it impassable to travelers. Females with calves are at all times dangerous to approach. When an Asian elephant makes a charge, it tightly curls up its trunk and attacks by trampling its victim with feet or knees, or, if a male, by pinning it to the ground with its tusks. During musth, bulls are highly dangerous, not only to human beings, but also to other animals. At the first indications, trained elephants are secured tightly to prevent any mishaps. There is also one case of a rogue elephant having actually consumed a human, an attack merited to be extremely unnatural. The elephant, a rogue female, had previously lost her calf to an accident involving farmers. This grievous loss led the elephant to target humans first as a threat, and then as a food source as her mental state deteriorated until she was finally killed and later dissected, revealing through DNA analysis that she had indeed consumed human flesh. The incident was revealed to the general public in several articles and in the Animal Planet documentary \"World's Deadliest Towns: Man-Eating Elephant\".Salmoni, Dave World's Deadliest Towns: Man-Eating Elephant. animal.discovery.com Domestication The first historical record of the domestication of Asian elephants was in Harappan times.McIntosh, J.

Their ability to work under instruction makes them particularly useful for carrying heavy objects. They have been used particularly for timber-carrying in jungle areas. Other than their work use, they have been used in war, in ceremonies, and for carriage. They have been used for their ability to travel over difficult terrain by hunters, for whom they served as mobile hunting platforms. The same purpose is met in safaris in modern times."}, {"description": "The elephant plays an important part in the culture of the subcontinent and beyond, featuring prominently in Jataka tales and the Panchatantra.

Notable amongst these is the Matanga Lila (\"Elephant sport\") of Rameswara Pandita and the Hastividyarnava of Sukumar Barkaith. The latter manuscript is from Assam in northeast India."}, {"description": "Elephants are crepuscular. They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg of plant matter per day. They are generalist feeders, and both grazers and browsers, and were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, and the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season. They drink at least once a day and are never far from a permanent source of fresh water. They need 80\u2013200 litres of water a day and use even more for bathing. At times, they scrape the soil for clay or minerals.Adult females and calves may move about together as groups, but adult males disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence. Bull elephants may be solitary or form temporary 'bachelor groups'.Cow-calf unit sizes generally tend to be small, typically consisting of three adult females which are most likely related, and their offspring; however, larger groups containing as many as 15 adult females may occur. There can also be seasonal aggregations containing 100 individuals at a time, including calves and subadults. Until recently, Asian elephants, like African elephants, were thought to typically follow the leadership of older adult females, or matriarchs, but females can form extensive and very fluid social networks, with individual variation in the degree of gregariousness. Social ties generally tend to be weaker than in African elephants.Elephants are able to distinguish low amplitude sounds. They use infrasound to communicate; this was first noted by the Indian naturalist Krishnan and later studied by Payne.Tiger predation on Asian elephants is rare but is not restricted only to small calves. Reproduction Bulls will fight one another to get access to estrous females. Strong fights over access to females are extremely rare. Bulls reach sexual maturity around the age of 12\u201315. Between the age of 10 and 20 years, bulls undergo an annual phenomenon known as \"musth\". This is a period where the testosterone level is up to 100 times greater than nonmusth periods, and they become extremely aggressive. Secretions containing pheromones occur during this period, from the paired temporal glands located on the head between the lateral edge of the eye and the base of the ear.The gestation period is 18\u201322 months, and the female gives birth to one calf, only occasionally twins. The calf is fully developed by the 19th month, but stays in the womb to grow so that it can reach its mother to feed. At birth, the calf weighs about 100 kg, and is suckled for up to three years. Once a female gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned, resulting in a 4- to 5-year birth interval. Females stay on with the herd, but mature males are chased away.Asiatic elephants reach adulthood at 17 years of age in both sexes. Elephants' life expectancy has been exaggerated in the past; they live on average for 60 years in the wild and 80 in captivity.Females produce sex pheromones; a principal component thereof, (Z)-7-dodecen-1-yl acetate, has also been found to be a sex pheromone in numerous species of insects."}, {"description": "Asian elephants inhabit grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants occur from sea level to over 3000 m. In the Eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above 3000 m in summer at a few sites.Choudhury, A. U. (1999). Status and Conservation of the Asian elephant Elephas maximus in north-eastern India. Mammal Review 29: 141\u2013173. In China, Asian elephants survive only in the prefectures of Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang of southern Yunnan. In Bangladesh, only isolated populations survive in the Chittagong Hills.Three subspecies are recognized: the Sri Lankan elephant occurs in Sri Lanka; the Indian elephant occurs in mainland Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Laos, Malay Peninsula, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam; the Sumatran elephant occurs in Sumatra. The Borneo elephant occurs in Borneo's northern and northeastern parts. In 2003, mitochondrial DNA analysis and microsatellite data indicated that the Borneo elephant population is derived from stock that originated in the region of the Sunda Islands. The genetic divergence of Borneo elephants warrants their recognition as a separate Evolutionary Significant Unit."}, {"description": "Elephas maximus is listed on CITES Appendix I.Asian elephants are quintessential flagship species, deployed to catalyze a range of conservation goals, including: habitat conservation at landscape scales generating public awareness of conservation issues mobilization as a popular cultural icon both in India and the West In captivity About half of the global zoo elephant population is kept in European zoos, where they have about half the median life span of conspecifics in protected populations in range countries. This discrepancy is clearest in Asian elephants: infant mortality is twice that seen in Burmese timber camps, and its adult survivorship in zoos has not improved significantly in recent years. One risk factor for Asian zoo elephants is being moved between institutions, with early removal from the mother tending to have additional adverse effects. Another risk factor is being born into a zoo rather than being imported from the wild, with poor adult survivorship in zoo-born Asians apparently being conferred prenatally or in early infancy. Likely causes for compromised survivorship is stress and/or obesity.full text mirrorDemographic analysis of the captive Asian elephants in North America indicates that the population is not self-sustaining. First year mortality is nearly 30%, and the fecundity is extremely low throughout the prime reproductive years. Data from North American and European regional studbooks from 1962 to 2006 were analysed for deviation of the birth and juvenile death sex ratio. Of 349 captive calves born, 142 died prematurely. They died within 1 month of birth; major causes being stillbirth and infanticide by either the calf's own mother or by one of the exhibition mates. The sex ratio of stillbirths in Europe was found to have a tendency for excess of males."}, {"description": "In general, the Asian elephant is smaller than the African elephant and has the highest body point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally. It has up to 20 pairs of ribs and 34 caudal vertebrae. The feet have more nail-like structures than those of African elephants\u2014five on each forefoot, and four on each hind foot. SizeAs is common with large animals, the dimensions of the Asian elephant are often exaggerated. On average, the shoulder height of males rarely exceeds 2.7 m and that of the females, 2.4 m. Average height of females is 2.24 m, and average weight 2.72 t rarely exceeding 4.16 t. Large bulls weigh up to 5.4 t and are 3.2 m at the shoulder. Length of body and head including trunk is 5.5 - with the tail being 1.2 - long. The largest bull elephant ever recorded was shot by the Maharajah of Susang in the Garo Hills of Assam, India in 1924, it weighed 8 t, stood 3.35 m tall at the shoulders and was 8.06 m long from head to tail.Wood, G.L. (1982) The Guinness book of animal facts and feats. Guinness Superlatives. ISBN 0-85112-235-3 There are reports of larger individuals as tall as 3.7 m. Trunk The distinctive trunk is an elongation of the nose and upper lip combined; the nostrils are at its tip, which has a one finger-like process. The trunk contains as many as 60,000 muscles, which consist of longitudinal and radiating sets. The longitudinals are mostly superficial and subdivided into anterior, lateral, and posterior. The deeper muscles are best seen as numerous distinct fasciculi in a cross-section of the trunk. The trunk is a multipurpose prehensile organ and highly sensitive, innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve and by the facial nerve. The acute sense of smell uses both the trunk and Jacobson's organ. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, watering, feeding, touching, dusting, sound production and communication, washing, pinching, grasping, defense and offense.The \"proboscis\" or trunk consists wholly of muscular and membranous tissue, and is a tapering muscular structure of nearly circular cross-section extending proximally from attachment at the anterior nasal orifice, and ending distally in a tip or finger. The length may vary from 1.5 to or longer depending on the species and age. Four basic muscle masses\u2014the radial, the longitudinal and two oblique layers\u2014and the size and attachments points of the tendon masses allow the shortening, extension, bending, and twisting movements accounting for the ability to hold, and manipulate loads of up to 300 kg. Muscular and tendinous ability combined with nervous control allows extraordinary strength and agility movements of the trunk, such as sucking and spraying of water or dust and directed air flow blowing.Rasmussen, L. E. L. (2006) Chapter 32. Chemical, Tactile, and Taste Sensory Systems. In: Fowler, M. E., Mikota, S. K. Biology, medicine, and surgery of elephants. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK. ISBN 978-0-8138-0676-1. pp. 409 ff.The trunk can hold about four litres of water. Elephants will playfully wrestle with each other using their trunks, but generally use their trunks only for gesturing when fighting. Tusks Tusks serve to dig for water, salt, and rocks, to debark trees, as levers for maneuvering fallen trees and branches, for work, for display, for marking trees, as weapon for offense and defense, as trunk-rests, as protection for the trunk. They are known to be right or left tusked.Female Asian elephants usually lack tusks; if tusks\u2014in that case called \"tushes\"\u2014are present, they are barely visible, and only seen when the mouth is open. The enamel plates of the molars are greater in number and closer together in Asian elephants. Some males may also lack tusks; these individuals are called \"filsy makhnas\", and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population. Furthermore, the forehead has two hemispherical bulges, unlike the flat front of the African elephant. Unlike African elephants which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil, Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects. They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.A record tusk described by George P. Sanderson measured 5 ft along the curve, with a girth of 16 in at the point of emergence from the jaw, the weight being 104+1/2 lb. This was from an elephant killed by Sir Brooke and measured 8 ft in length, and nearly 17 in in circumference, and weighed 90 lb. The tusk's weight was, however, exceeded by the weight of a shorter tusk of about 6 ft in length which weighed 100 lb. Skin Skin color is usually gray, and may be masked by soil because of dusting and wallowing. Their wrinkled skin is movable and contains many nerve centers. It is smoother than of African elephants, and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears, or neck. The epidermis and dermis of the body average 18 mm thick; skin on the dorsum is 30 mm thick providing protection against bites, bumps, and adverse weather. Its folds increase surface area for heat dissipation. They can tolerate cold better than excessive heat. Skin temperature varies from 24 to. Body temperature averages 35.9 C. Intelligence Asian elephants are highly intelligent and self-aware. They have a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species. Asian elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing of all existing land animals. Elephants have a volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing that exceeds that of any primate species, and extensive studies place elephants in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool making. They exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, including those associated with grief, learning, allomothering, mimicry, play, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory, and language. Elephants are reported to go to safer ground during natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes, although there have been no scientific records of this since it is hard to recreate or predict natural disasters."}, {"description": "The Asian or Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus) is the only living species of the genus Elephas and is distributed in Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are recognized\u2014Elephas maximus maximus from Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant or E. m. indicus from mainland Asia, and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra. Asian elephants are the largest living land animals in Asia.Since 1986, E. maximus has been listed as endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 50% over the last three generations, estimated to be 60\u201375 years. Asian elephants are primarily threatened by degradation, fragmentation and loss of habitat, and poaching. In 2003, the wild population was estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, such as forest camps. In zoos, elephants die at a much younger age and are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.The genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene, and ranged throughout Africa into southern Asia.Haynes, G.

Originally named Lutra marina, it underwent numerous name changes before being accepted as Enhydra lutris in 1922. The generic name Enhydra, derives from the Ancient Greek en/\u03b5\u03bd \"in\" and hydra/\u03cd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1 \"water\", meaning \"in the water\", and the Latin word lutris, meaning \"otter\".Nickerson, p. 19The sea otter was formerly sometimes referred to as the \"sea beaver\", being the marine fur-bearer similar in commercial value to the terrestrial beaver. Rodents (of which the beaver is one) are not closely related to otters, which are carnivores. It is not to be confused with the marine otter, a rare otter species native to the southern west coast of South America. A number of other otter species, while predominantly living in fresh water, are commonly found in marine coastal habitats. The extinct sea mink of northeast North America is another mustelid that had adapted to a marine environment. EvolutionThe sea otter is the heaviest (the giant otter is longer, but significantly slimmer) member of the family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 otter species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks. It is unique among the mustelids in not making dens or burrows, in having no functional anal scent glands,Kenyon, p. 4 and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea otter is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the earless seals. Genetic analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated otter, European otter, African clawless otter and oriental small-clawed otter, shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).Fossil evidence indicates the Enhydra lineage became isolated in the North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris.Love, p. 9 The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaid\u014d and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast.Love, pp. 15\u201316 In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence.Love, pp. 4\u20136 In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.Love, p. 6One related species has been described, Enhydra reevei, from the Pleistocene of East Anglia. The holotype, a lower carnassial, was in the Norwich Castle Museum but seems to be lost. Only one more specimen, an extremely worn lower carnassial, is known.

The reintroduction effort off the Oregon coast was not successful. However, reintroductions in 1969 and 1970 off the Washington coast were very successful and sea otters have been expanding their range since. They have now entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca and can be found almost as far east as Pillar Point. Individuals have even been seen in the San Juan Islands and northern Puget Sound."}, {"description": "Fur tradeSea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.In the early 18th century, Russians began to hunt sea otters in the Kuril IslandsSilverstein, p. 34 and sold them to the Chinese at Kyakhta. Russia was also exploring the far northern Pacific at this time, and sent Vitus Bering to map the Arctic coast and find routes from Siberia to North America. In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was shipwrecked off Bering Island in the Commander Islands, where he and many of his crew died. The surviving crew members, which included naturalist Georg Steller, discovered sea otters on the beaches of the island and spent the winter hunting sea otters and gambling with otter pelts. They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts.Silverstein, p. 35 Thus began what is sometimes called the \"Great Hunt\", which would continue for another hundred years. The Russians found the sea otter far more valuable than the sable skins that had driven and paid for most of their expansion across Siberia. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth the cost of Bering's expedition.James R Gibson, \"Feeding the Russian Fur Trade\",1969, page 17 In 1775 at Okhotsk, sea otter pelts were worth 50\u201380 rubles as opposed to 2.5 rubles for sable. Russian fur-hunting expeditions soon depleted the sea otter populations in the Commander Islands, and by 1745, they began to move on to the Aleutian Islands. The Russians initially traded with the Aleuts inhabitants of these islands for otter pelts, but later enslaved the Aleuts, taking women and children hostage and torturing and killing Aleut men to force them to hunt. Many Aleuts were either murdered by the Russians or died from diseases the hunters had introduced. The Aleut population was reduced, by the Russians' own estimate, from 20,000 to 2,000. By the 1760s, the Russians had reached Alaska. In 1799, Emperor Paul I consolidated the rival fur-hunting companies into the Russian-American Company, granting it an imperial charter and protection, and a monopoly over trade rights and territorial acquisition. Under Aleksandr I, the administration of the merchant-controlled company was transferred to the Imperial Navy, largely due to the alarming reports by naval officers of native abuse; in 1818, the indigenous peoples of Alaska were granted civil rights equivalent to a townsman status in the Russian Empire.Middleton, pg.8,Other nations joined in the hunt in the south. Along the coasts of what is now Mexico and California, Spanish explorers bought sea otter pelts from Native Americans and sold them in Asia.Silverstein, p. 37 In 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook reached Vancouver Island and bought sea otter furs from the First Nations people.Silverstein, p. 38 When Cook's ship later stopped at a Chinese port, the pelts rapidly sold at high prices, and were soon known as \"soft gold\". As word spread, people from all over Europe and North America began to arrive in the Pacific Northwest to trade for sea otter furs.Russian hunting expanded to the south, initiated by American ship captains, who subcontracted Russian supervisors and Aleut hunters Farris, pg.21, in what are now Washington, Oregon, and California. Between 1803 and 1846, 72 American ships were involved in the otter hunt in California, harvesting an estimated 40,000 skins and tails, compared to only 13 ships of the Russian-American Company, which reported 5,696 otter skins taken between 1806 and 1846.Mathes, pg.326, In 1812, the Russians founded an agricultural settlement at what is now Fort Ross in northern California, as their southern headquarters. Eventually, sea otter populations became so depleted, commercial hunting was no longer viable. It had stopped the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a conservation measure imposed by the Russian-American Company.Middleton, pg.4 Further restrictions were ordered by the Company in 1834. When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly extirpated the sea otter again.Silverstein, p. 40 Prices rose as the species became rare. During the 1880s, a pelt brought $105 to $165 in the London market, but by 1903, a pelt could be worth as much as $1,125. In 1911, Russia, Japan, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States signed the Treaty for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals, imposing a moratorium on the harvesting of sea otters.VanBlaricom, p. 50 So few remained, perhaps only 1,000\u20132,000 individuals in the wild, that many believed the species would become extinct. Recovery and conservation During the 20th century, sea otter numbers rebounded in about two-thirds of their historic range, a recovery that is considered one of the greatest successes in marine conservation.VanBlaricom, p. 53 However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by killer whales, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries\u00a0\u2013 sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States.VanBlaricom, p. 65 Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.VanBlaricom, p. 62The most significant threat to sea otters is oil spills. They are particularly vulnerable, as they rely on their fur to keep warm. When their fur is soaked with oil, it loses its ability to retain air, and the animals can quickly die from hypothermia. The liver, kidneys, and lungs of sea otters also become damaged after they inhale oil or ingest it when grooming. The Exxon Valdez oil spill of 24 March 1989 killed thousands of sea otters in Prince William Sound, and as of 2006, the lingering oil in the area continues to affect the population. Describing the public sympathy for sea otters that developed from media coverage of the event, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson wrote: The small geographic ranges of the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation for the rescue of otters in the event of one are major areas of focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also reduce the risk of an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.Nickerson, pp. 47\u201348In the Aleutian Islands, a massive and unexpected disappearance of sea otters has occurred in recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances is consistent with a rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.Another area of concern is California, where recovery began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and by opossums, and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed to the deaths of many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.Sea otter habitat is preserved through several protected areas in the United States, Russia and Canada. In marine protected areas, polluting activities such as dumping of waste and oil drilling are typically prohibited. An estimated 1,200 sea otters live within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and more than 500 live within the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. Economic impactSome of the sea otter's preferred prey species, particularly abalone, clams, and crabs, are also food sources for humans. In some areas, massive declines in shellfish harvests have been blamed on the sea otter, and intense public debate has taken place over how to manage the competition between sea otters and humans for seafood. The debate is complicated because sea otters have sometimes been held responsible for declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity.Love, pp. 93\u201398 Shellfish declines have also occurred in many parts of the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. Although many factors affect shellfish stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area,VanBlaricom, p. 34 and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish, as well.Many facets of the interaction between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products.Silverstein, p. 49 Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations.Nickerson, p. 70 The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.

Both items are on display at the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St. Petersburg. Articles depicting sea otters were considered to have magical properties.Lyapunova R.G. (1963) Museum materials on the Aleuts. Catalog of the Museum of anthropology and ethnography. Academy of Sciences, USSR, vol. XXI. For many maritime indigenous cultures throughout the North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the Kuril Islands, the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii and a host of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the sea otter has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter baculum as a medicine for fever.Love, pp 34\u201335 Among the Ainu, the otter is portrayed as an occasional messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters.F. A. Golder. (1905) Aleutian Stories. The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 18, No. 70. (July\u2013September), pp. 215\u2013222. These links have been associated with the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism.N.

The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations\u00a0 the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.Hatch, David R.

North Bend, OR: Coquille Indian Tribe.Since the mid-1970s, the beauty and charisma of the species have gained wide appreciation, and the sea otter has become an icon of environmental conservation. The round, expressive face and soft, furry body of the sea otter are depicted in a wide variety of souvenirs, postcards, clothing, and stuffed toys.Love, p. 97 H1N1 hostAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey and the CDC, northern sea otters, off the coast of Washington state, are infected with the H1N1 flu virus and \"may be a newly identified animal host of influenza viruses\". Aquariums and zoosSea otters can do well in captivity, and are featured in over 40 public aquariums and zoos.VanBlaricom p. 69 The Seattle Aquarium became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of Tichuk in 1979, followed by three more pups in the early 1980s. In 2007, a YouTube video of two sea otters holding paws drew 1.5 million viewers in two weeks, and had over 20 million views . Filmed five years previously at the Vancouver Aquarium, it was YouTube's most popular animal video at the time, although it has since been surpassed. The lighter-colored otter in the video is Nyac, a survivor of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Nyac died in September 2008, at the age of 20. Milo, the darker one, died of lymphoma in January, 2012"}, {"description": "Sea otters live in coastal waters 15 to 23\u00a0meters (50 to 75\u00a0ft) deep,Silverstein, p. 17 and usually stay within a kilometer (\u2154\u00a0mi) of the shore.Nickerson, p. 49 They are found most often in areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs.Silverstein, p. 19 Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live in areas where the sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt.VanBlaricom, p. 14 Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice.Kenyon, p. 133 Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.Love, pp. 67\u201369The sea otter population is thought to have once been 150,000 to 300,000, stretching in an arc across the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. The fur trade that began in the 1740s reduced the sea otter's numbers to an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 members in 13 colonies. In about two-thirds of its former range, the species is at varying levels of recovery, with high population densities in some areas and threatened populations in others. Sea otters currently have stable populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, with reports of recolonizations in Mexico and Japan.VanBlaricom, p. 54 Population estimates made between 2004 and 2007 give a worldwide total of approximately 107,000 sea otters. RussiaCurrently, the most stable and secure part of the sea otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the population in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. As of 2004, sea otters have repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.Kornev S.I., Korneva S.M. (2004) Population dynamics and present status of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) of the Kuril Islands and southern Kamchatka. Marine Mammals of the Holarctic, Proceedings of 2004 conference. p. 273\u2013278. AlaskaAlaska is the heartland of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the population in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals.Nickerson, p. 46 By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts for most of the change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989. British ColumbiaAlong the North American coast south of Alaska, the sea otter's range is discontinuous. A remnant population survived off Vancouver Island into the 20th century, but it died out despite the 1911 international protection treaty, with the last sea otter taken near Kyuquot in 1929. From 1969 to 1972, 89 sea otters were flown or shipped from Alaska to the west coast of Vancouver Island. This population expanded to over 3,200 as of 2004, and their range on the island's west coast expanded from Cape Scott in the north to Barkley Sound to the south. In 1989, a separate colony was discovered in the central British Columbia coast. It is not known if this colony, which numbered about 300 animals in 2004, was founded by transplanted otters or by survivors of the fur trade.The status of the sea otters has improved since 2004 with a report of 4,700 in 2008 that improved their status to \"special concern\" in Canada.Sea Otter, Species at Risk Public Registry They currently occupy much of the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island and parts of the central mainland BC coast. Sea Otters, Fisheries and Oceans Canada WashingtonIn 1969 and 1970, 59 sea otters were translocated from Amchitka Island to Washington. Annual surveys between 2000 and 2004 have recorded between 504 and 743 individuals, and their range is in the Olympic Peninsula from just south of Destruction Island to Pillar Point. In Washington, sea otters are found almost exclusively on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always turn out to be North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s. CaliforniaThe 2013 United States Geological Survey (USGS) found 2,941 California sea otters, a slight increase from 2012 but a portion of the increase is artificial because the count includes, for the first time, the San Nicolas Island population which has recovered to 59 individuals.For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from threatened species listing, the population would have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. The California sea otter census in 2012 was 2,792, down from the peak spring 2007 census of 3,026 sea otters, but up from the recent low of 2,711 in 2010. The historic population is estimated at 16,000 before the fur trade began. California's sea otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern sea otters discovered near Bixby Bridge in Big Sur in 1938.Silverstein, p. 41 Their principal range has gradually expanded and extends from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County. In the late 1980s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) relocated about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island in southern California, in the hope of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. As of 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they are slowly increasing as they thrive on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. However, as of 2012 the San Nicolas Island population had increased only to about 50 individuals.When the FWS implemented the translocation program, it also attempted to implement \"zonal management\" of the Californian population. To manage the competition between sea otters and fisheries, it declared an \"otter-free zone\" stretching from Point Conception to the Mexican border. In this zone, only San Nicolas Island was designated as sea otter habitat, and sea otters found elsewhere in the area were supposed to be captured and relocated. These plans were abandoned after many translocated otters died and also as it proved impractical to capture the hundreds of otters which ignored regulations and swam into the zone. However, after engaging in a period of public commentary in 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to release a formal decision on the issue. Then, in response to lawsuits filed by lthe Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center and the Otter Project, on December 19, 2012 the USFWS declared that the \"no otter zone\" experiment was a failure, and will protect the otters re-colonizing the coast south of Point Conception as threatened species.Sea otters were once numerous in San Francisco Bay.Southern Sea Otters. nrdc.org Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce on his second voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent at the mouth of Corte Madera Creek.Although the southern sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant population of about 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 are only slowly recovering. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary has moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2\u00a0km southeast of Pigeon Point, and the southern boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.Otters were observed twice in Southern California in 2011, once near Laguna Beach and once at Zuniga Point Jetty, near San Diego. These are the first documented sightings of otters this far south in 30 years. OregonThe last native sea otter in Oregon was probably shot and killed in 1906. In 1970 and 1971, a total of 95 sea otters were transplanted from Amchitka Island, Alaska to the Southern Oregon coast. However, this translocation effort failed and otters soon again disappeared from the state.In 2004, a lone male sea otter took up residence at Simpson Reef off of Cape Arago for six months. This male is thought to have originated from a colony in Washington, but disappeared after a coastal storm.The most recent sighting of a sea otter off the Oregon coast took place on 18 February 2009, in Depoe Bay, Oregon. The lone male sea otter could have traveled from either California or Washington."}, {"description": "The sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammal species, but it is the heaviest mustelid.VanBlaricom, p. 11 Male sea otters usually weigh 22 to and are 1.2 to in length, though specimens to 54 kg have been recorded.The Wildlife Year. The Reader's Digest Association, Inc. (1991). ISBN 0-276-42012-8. Females are smaller, weighing 14 to and measuring 1.0 to in length. Its baculum (penis bone) is, for the male otter's size, very large, massive and bent upwards, measuring 150 mm in length and 15 mm at the base.Unlike most other marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its exceptionally thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 strands of hair per square centimeter (nearly one million per sq\u00a0in), its fur is the densest of any animal.Silverstein, p. 14 The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is thus kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually rather than in a distinct molting season.Kenyon, pp. 37\u201339 As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton.Love, p. 21 and 28 The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black.Love, p. 27 In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color than the rest of the body.The sea otter displays numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close.Silverstein, p. 13 The hind feet, which provide most of its propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult.Kenyon, p. 70 The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey.Silverstein, p. 11 The sea otter propels itself underwater by moving the rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down,Love, p. 21 and is capable of speeds of up to 9\u00a0km/h (5.6\u00a0mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest.Kenyon, p. 62 When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side.Love, p. 22 At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling.VanBlaricom, p. 64 The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity \u2013 about 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals \u2013 and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.Long, highly sensitive whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky.VanBlaricom, p. 11 and 21 Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when the wind is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense.Kenyon, p. 55 Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals.Love, p. 23 Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.Kenyon, p. 56An adult's 32 teeth, particularly the molars, are flattened and rounded, designed to crush rather than cut food.Kenyon, p. 43 Seals and sea otters are the only carnivores with two pairs of lower incisor teeth rather than three;Love, p. 74 the adult dental formula is Kenyon, p. 47 The sea otter has a metabolic rate two or three times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment.VanBlaricom, p. 17 Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%,Love, p.24 and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.A sea otter has two types of fur, the underfur and the guard hair. The shape of these different hair fibers connect to trap air between them. This allows them to maintain their body heat without the blubber other sea mammals use.

In most of its range, the sea otter's diet consists almost exclusively of marine invertebrates, including sea urchins, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses.VanBlaricom pp. 18\u201329 Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3\u00a0inches (7\u00a0cm) across.Love, p. 96In a few northern areas, fish are also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish.Kenyon, p. 121 The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor part of the sea otter's diet.Love, p. 76 Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.Kenyon, p. 119The individuals within a particular area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers.VanBlaricom, p. 29 The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices,VanBlaricom, p. 30 however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area.Nickerson, p. 57 A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, a wider variety of prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful. As a keystone speciesSea otters are a classic example of a keystone species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.VanBlaricom, p. 33In addition to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters can also have a profound effect in rocky areas that tend to be dominated by mussel beds. They remove mussels from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area. PredatorsPredation of sea otters does occur, although it is not common. Many predators find the otter, with their pungent scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators of this species include killer whales and sea lions; bald eagles also prey on pups by snatching them from the water surface. On land, young sea otters may face attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, particularly great white sharks, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and are one of the reasons the population has not expanded further north. The great white shark is believed to be their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although there is no evidence that sharks actually eat them. An exhibit at the San Diego Natural History Museum states that cat feces from urban runoff carry Toxoplasma gondii parasites to the ocean and kill sea otters.http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu/RESEARCH/PROJPROF_PDF/Conrad_CZ169.pdf"}, {"description": "The sea otter is diurnal. It has a period of foraging and eating in the morning, starting about an hour before sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day.Love, pp. 69\u201370 Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.Love, pp. 70\u201371Sea otters spend much of their time grooming, which consists of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur.Kenyon, p. 76 When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur. ForagingThe sea otter hunts in short dives, often to the sea floor. Although it can hold its breath for up to five minutes, its dives typically last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.Nickerson, p. 21Under each foreleg, the sea otter has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish. To eat large sea urchins, which are mostly covered with spines, the sea otter bites through the underside where the spines are shortest, and licks the soft contents out of the urchin's shell.VanBlaricom, p. 22The sea otter's use of rocks when hunting and feeding makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. To pry an abalone off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with observed rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives. Social structure Although each adult and independent juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones.Love, p. 49 The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting out to sea when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.VanBlaricom, p. 45A male sea otter is most likely to mate if he maintains a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females.VanBlaricom, pp. 42\u201345 As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.Love, p. 50The species exhibits a variety of vocal behaviors. The cry of a pup is often compared to that of a seagull. Females coo when they are apparently content; males may grunt instead.Kenyon, pp. 78\u201379 Distressed or frightened adults may whistle, hiss, or in extreme circumstances, scream.Kenyon, p. 77Although sea otters can be playful and sociable, they are not considered to be truly social animals.Silverstein, p. 61 They spend much time alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense. Reproduction and lifecycle Sea otters are polygynous: males have multiple female partners. However, temporary pair-bonding occurs for a few days between a female in estrus and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male biting the female on the muzzle\u00a0\u2013 which often leaves scars on the nose\u00a0\u2013 and sometimes holding her head under water.At least one female is known to have died from an infected nose. (Love, p. 52)Births occur year-round, with peaks between May and June in northern populations and between January and March in southern populations. Gestation appears to vary from four to twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation followed by four months of pregnancy.Love, p. 54 In California, sea otters usually breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska.Silverstein, p. 30Birth usually takes place in the water and typically produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3\u00a0kg (3 to 5\u00a0lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur.Kenyon, p.44 Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive.Love, pp. 56\u201361 The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks. Nursing lasts six to eight months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother beginning to offer bits of prey at one to two months.Silverstein, pp. 31\u201332 The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than to that of other mustelids.Love, p. 61 A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at six to eight months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it;Love, p. 63 at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter\u00a0\u2013 by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.Love, p. 62Females perform all tasks of feeding and raising offspring, and have occasionally been observed caring for orphaned pups.Love, p. 59 Much has been written about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups\u00a0\u2013 a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur.Kenyon, p. 89 When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away;Silverstein, p. 31 if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns.Silverstein, p. 28 Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.Love, p. 58Females become sexually mature at around three or four years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not successfully breed until a few years later.Love, p. 53 A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10\u201315 years for males and 15\u201320 years for females.VanBlaricom, p. 71 Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium died at the age of 28 years.VanBlaricom, pp. 40\u201341 Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.VanBlaricom, p. 41There are several documented cases in which male sea otters have forcibly copulated with juvenile Harbor Seals, sometimes resulting in death.Heather S. Harris et al.

Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and, making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.The sea otter inhabits offshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.Sea otters, whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000\u2013300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, and the world population fell to 1,000\u20132,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species now occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an endangered species."}]}

A single group usually contains at least one adult male, but mixed groups with multiple males do also occur. In that case, one of the males is dominant. He accepts only a few monkeys in his direct surroundings, mainly younger animals and a few females. The dominant male and the group members that are close to him have the privilege to eat first in case of food scarcity, while subordinate monkeys have to wait until they are ready.After a gestation period of 180 days, one young is born, or incidentally a twin. This young, which weighs only 200 to 250\u00a0grams, is carried on the back of its mother. The mother feeds her child for 9 months, but the young is sexually immature until its seventh year, which is quite late for a primate of its size.Important natural enemies of the capuchin are large birds of prey. They are so afraid of those birds, that they even become alarmed when a harmless bird flies over.The tufted capuchin rubs urine on its hands and feet in order to attract mates and reduce stress. Diet A recently discovered characteristic of one population of this species is that it uses stones as a tool to open hard nuts. First it chooses ripe nuts from a nut palm. It uses its teeth to strip off the nut's fibrous husk. Then it leaves the nut to dry for about a week. When the nut is dry, the monkey lays the nut on a large, flat rock or fallen tree, hammering the nut with a suitable stone until the nut cracks. The hammer stones are often large enough to require lifting with both hands. The anvil rock is often pock-marked with hollows as a result of repeated use.Discovery \"Life\" series, \"Challenges of Life\" episode, David AttenboroughBesides nuts, the capuchin also eats fruit, insects and larvae, eggs and young birds, frogs, lizards, and even bats. They are also known to chase cats.The tufted capuchin looks for its food in groups. As soon as one of the group members has found something edible, he or she may make a large whistling sound, dependent upon the proximity of other individuals and abundance of the food resource, so that the other monkeys know that there is something to eat. The composition of the group is very well organized, and is determined by rank in the hierarchy. The dominant male often resides somewhere in the middle of the group just behind the front line, so that it is safer when a predator attacks. The vanguard is composed of higher-ranked females who are tolerated by the dominant male. They have the privilege to reach the food first, but they are also the most vulnerable when a predator attacks. Tool use and manufacture The tufted capuchin has been observed using containers to hold water, using sticks (to dig nuts, to dip for syrup, to catch ants, to reach food), using sponges to absorb juice, using stones as hammer and chisel to penetrate a barrier and using stones as hammer and anvil to crack nuts. While some of these tasks are relatively simple by cognitive standards (e.g. using a stick to catch ants), others, like cracking nuts with hammer and anvil are only exceeded in complexity by chimpanzees.The potential for tool use in animals like the Tufted Capuchin depends on a number of conditions that would increase its likelihood of appearing in a given species. Van Schaik proposed that the occurrence of tool use would be likely in foraging species if three factors were present: manual dexterity, intelligence, and social tolerance. As it applies to manual dexterity, capuchins are capable of a limited precision grip (the ability to delicately pinch and manipulate objects with the thumb and fingertips), which is not found in any other New World monkeys and only found in limited amounts in apes. C. apella has an encephalization ratio greater than the hominids (except humans) and a neocortex ratio that is almost as large as the apes; both of these rough indicators suggest high intelligence. Finally, the Tufted Capuchin forms social groups typical of a complex and tolerant society.The tufted capuchin has been observed manufacturing tools both in captivity and in the wild. In captivity, it has been reported as making probing sticks to reach normally inaccessible containers with syrup. It is also capable of understanding the concept of \"sponging\" and using paper towels, monkey biscuits, sticks, leaves and straw to sop up juice and then suck on the sponge to consume the juice. Research in the wild has shown that capuchin tool use is every bit as extensive as in captivity with capuchins being observed using stones to dig holes to get at tubers, an activity previously only seen in humans. The practice of using stones to crack nuts has arisen spontaneously in many locations such as in the Caatinga Dry Forest and Serra da Capivara National Park, all in Brazil and hundreds of miles apart. It has been observed cracking various nuts and fruits such as palm nuts (Attalea and Astrocaryum spp.) and jatob\u00e1 fruits.(Hymenaea courbaril) The tufted capuchin has even been observed using stones to dislodge other stones that would later be used as hammers or shovels, an example of a more complex tool using behavior known as second-order tool use previously only found in chimpanzees. Curiously, not all tufted capuchins engage in tool use. Moura and Lee (2004) suggest lack of other food sources as the key factor. Ottoni and Mannu (2001), Fragaszy et al. (2004) and Visalberghi et al. (2005) have proposed this is likely more a factor of a monkey's terrestrial habit: the more time a monkey spends on the ground, the more likely it is to profit from (and thus engage in) tool use.In captivity, the tufted capuchin has been seen to manufacture stone tools that produced simple flakes and cores. Some of the capuchins even used these sharpened stones to cut (in a back-and-forth motion) barriers in order to reach food. The importance of this behavior is that it serves as evidence of mechanical proclivity to modify stones by using behaviors already in the monkeys' repertoires, and this behavior is seen as a precursor to stone-knapping. This early and limited tool use behavior has been hypothesized as similar to pre-Homo habilis and that artifacts of that time would probably resemble those of capuchins.C. apella tool manufacture and use has been analyzed for potential clues to social learning and problem solving ability, as tool manufacture and use can often shed light on such complex cognitive abilities. Social learning, or the ability to learn from other individuals, is a controversial topic in most nonhuman species like C. apella because of the relative difficulty of determining whether a behavior was learned from imitation or a much simpler form of social learning. One way of closing the gap between concurrent tool related behaviors and their likelihood of arising from imitation is by narrowing down events that would make social learning more probable such as a preference for observing experienced tool users. In this regard, Ottoni and his team found that young capuchins tended to observe the best tool users when cracking nuts. Another way of isolating imitation from other simpler behaviors is to present the capuchins with a box that has food but has two different ways of opening it. The important point is that neither way should be more advantageous so that the monkey can freely choose one. In one such study, when humans opened the door in front of the monkeys using one way only, the monkeys used that method, even when they discovered the alternative on their own. In another study, capuchin alphas from two separate groups were trained to open the door in a specific way, after which the monkeys were paired with subordinates who learned to open the door in the same way. When capuchins are trained in the same way and this time released into their groups, the habit is once again disseminated amongst all group members even when others discover alternative ways. Nevertheless, the subject of whether or not C. apella learns by imitation is still controversial, because of the inherent difficulty in teasing out unambiguous evidence of a complex cognitive process such as imitation. Problem solving Tool use and manufacture can also shed light on the many aspects of the tufted capuchin's cognitive abilities by determining how it solves some problems. Some non-primates manufacture and use objects as tools. Crows are known to make hook-tools for catching insects, but such activities lack the behavioral plasticity of tool use as evidenced in tufted capuchins who found new ways to use tools that other species could not. But this plasticity in tool use, while suggesting greater complexity and cognitive ability, does not suggest that the monkeys understand cause and effect. It instead implies they are only able to learn from successful efforts but not from failures nor are they able to refine and improve much. Its ability to repeat successes, coupled with its complex repertoire of behavioral events helps to explain the Tufted Capuchin's extensive repertoire of innovative behaviors besides tool use."}, {"description": "The tufted capuchin (Cebus apella), also known as brown capuchin, black-capped capuchin, or pin monkey is a New World primate from South America. As traditionally defined, it is one of the most widespread primates in the Neotropics, but it has recently been recommended considering the black-striped, black and Golden-bellied Capuchins as separate species in a new genus, thereby effectively limiting the tufted capuchin to the Amazon Basin and nearby regions.The tufted capuchin is an omnivorous animal, mostly feeding on fruits and invertebrates, although it sometimes feeds on small vertebrates (e.g. lizards and bird chicks) and other plant parts. It can be found in many different kinds of environment, including moist tropical and subtropical forest, dry forest, and disturbed or secondary forest.Like other capuchins, it is a social animal, forming groups of 8 to 15 individuals that are led by an alpha or dominant male."}]}

Similarly, the Estonian name is ahm, with the equivalent meaning to the Finnish name. In Lithuanian is ernis, in Latvian\u2014tinis or \u0101mrija.The Eastern Slavic \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430 (rosomakha) and the Polish and Czech name rosom\u00e1k seem to be borrowed from the Finnish rasva-maha (fat belly). Similarly, the Hungarian name is rozsom\u00e1k or torkosborz which means \"gluttonous badger\".In French-speaking parts of Canada, the wolverine is referred to as carcajou, borrowed from the Innu-aimun or Montagnais ku\u00e0ku\u00e0tsheu. However in France, the wolverine's name is glouton (glutton).Purported gluttony is reflected neither in the English name wolverine nor in the names used in North Germanic languages. The English word wolverine (alteration of the earlier form wolvering of uncertain origin) probably implies \"a little wolf\". The name in Proto-Norse, erafaz and Old Norse, jarfr, lives on in the regular Icelandic name jarfi, regular Norwegian name jerv, regular Swedish name j\u00e4rv and regular Danish name j\u00e6rv."}, {"description": "Many cities, teams, and organizations use the wolverine as a mascot. For example, the US state of Michigan is, by tradition, known as \"the Wolverine State\", and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the \"Wolverines\". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years. The animal was found dead in 2010 and the story recounted in the book The Lone Wolverine.The wolverine figures prominently in the mythology of the Innu people of eastern Qu\u00e9bec and Labrador.

The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.Glenn Hurowitz (2008-03-05). \"First wolverine in 30 years spotted in California\", Grist.org; alsoThe range of a male wolverine can be more than 620\u00a0km2 (240\u00a0mi2), encompassing the ranges of several females which have smaller home ranges of roughly 130\u2013260\u00a0km2 (50\u2013100\u00a0mi2). Adult wolverines try for the most part to keep nonoverlapping ranges with adults of the same sex. Radio tracking suggests an animal can range hundreds of miles in a few months.Female wolverines burrow into snow in February to create a den, which is used until weaning in mid-May. Areas inhabited nonseasonally by wolverines are thus restricted to zones with late-spring snowmelts. This fact has led to concern that global warming will shrink the ranges of wolverine populations.This requirement for large territories brings wolverines into conflict with human development, and hunting and trapping further reduce their numbers, causing them to disappear from large parts of their former range; attempts to have them declared an endangered species have met with little success. In February 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed giving Endangered Species Act protections to the wolverine due to its winter habitat in the northern Rockies diminishing. This was as a result of a lawsuit by brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife.U.S. Proposes to Protect Wolverines February 1, 2013 New York TimesThe Wildlife Conservation Society reported in June 2009 that a wolverine researchers had been tracking for almost three months had crossed into northern Colorado.

Prey mainly consists of small to medium-sized mammals, but the wolverine has been recorded killing prey such as adult deer that are many times larger than itself. Prey species include porcupines, squirrels, beavers, marmots, rabbits, voles, mice, shrews, lemmings, caribou, roe deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer, sheep, moose, and elk.Gulo gulo (wolverine), Animal Diversity Web Smaller predators are occasionally preyed on, including martens, mink, foxes, Eurasian lynx,V.G. Heptner and A.A. Sludskii. Mammals of the Soviet Union. Volume II Part 2 Carnivora: Hyenas and Cats. 1992. New Delhi: Amerind Publishing, p. 625 weasels, and coyote and wolf pups. Wolverines often pursue live prey that are relatively easy to obtain, including animals caught in traps, newborn mammals, and deer (including adult moose and elk) when they are weakened by winter or immobilized by heavy snow. Their diets are sometimes supplemented by birds' eggs, birds (especially geese), roots, seeds, insect larvae, and berries. A majority of the wolverine's sustenance is derived from carrion, on which they depend almost exclusively in winter and early spring. Wolverines may find carrion themselves, feed on it after the predator is done feeding (especially wolf packs) or simply take it from another predator. Whether eating live prey or carrion, the wolverine's feeding style appears voracious, leading to the nickname of \"glutton\" (also the basis of the scientific name). However, this feeding style is believed to be an adaptation to food scarcity, especially in winter.Wolverine Gulo gulo, eNature.comArmed with powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a thick hide, wolverines, like most mustelids, are remarkably strong for their size. They may defend kills against larger or more numerous predators such as wolves or bears. At least one account reported a wolverine's apparent attempt to steal a kill from a black bear, although the bear won what was ultimately a fatal contest. In another account, a wolverine attacked a polar bear and clung to its throat until the bear suffocated. Wolverines are known to follow wolf and lynx trails, purportedly with the intent of scavenging the remains of their kills. Wolves are thought to be their most important natural predator, with the arrival of wolves to a wolverine's territory presumably leading the latter to abandon the area.Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) hunt more actively than their North American relatives.World Wildlife Fund\u2013Sweden: 1st International Symposium on Wolverine Research and Management (PDF) This may be because competing predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill and then try to snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material. Mating and reproductionSuccessful males will form lifetime relationships with two or three females, which they will visit occasionally, while other males are left without a mate. Mating season is in the summer, but the actual implantation of the embryo (blastocyst) in the uterus is stayed until early winter, delaying the development of the fetus. Females will often not produce young if food is scarce. The gestation period is 30\u201350 days, and litters of typically two or three young (\"kits\") are born in the spring. Kits develop rapidly, reaching adult size within the first year of a lifespan that may reach anywhere from five to (in exceptional individuals) 13 years. Fathers make visits to their offspring until they are weaned at 10 weeks of age; also, once the young are about six months old, some reconnect with their fathers and travel together for a time."}, {"description": "The wolverine , Gulo gulo (Gulo is Latin for \"glutton\"), also referred to as glutton, carcajou, skunk bear, or quickhatch, is the largest land-dwelling species of the family Mustelidae (weasels).

The wolverine, a solitary animal, has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.The wolverine can be found primarily in remote reaches of the Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in northern Canada, the U.S. state of Alaska, the Nordic countries of Europe, and throughout western Russia and Siberia. Their populations have experienced a steady decline since the 19th century in the face of trapping, range reduction and habitat fragmentation, such that they are essentially absent in the southern end of their European range."}]}

Bandicoots are not social animals and do not live in groups, with the exception of mother and her young.The northern brown bandicoot breeds throughout the year. An average litter consists of 2 to 4 young. Being marsupials, the newborns are naked and immature and thus undergo extensive development within the mother's pouch. The gestation period (12.5 days) is the shortest recorded for any mammal. Bandicoots are also the only metatherian marsupials that have placentas similar to eutherian mammals. Juveniles are weaned at 60 days post partum. By this time, the marsupial young are capable of sustaining endothermy on their own. I. macrourus have a lifespan of approximately two years.Female bandicoots produce between 8 and 11 litters in their lifetime. Male bandicoots don't play a significant role in the care of juvenile I. macrourus."}, {"description": "Australia"}]}

They are social animals that may live in clans consisting of one adult of each gender and associated young, though there are reports of clans composed of four males and six females. It is thought that in the latter situation, there is at least one dominant male. Brown hyenas maintain a stable clan hierarchy through ritualized aggressive displays and mock fights. They typically forage alone, and do not maintain a territory, instead using common hunting paths. Emigration is common in brown hyena clans, particularly among young males, which will join other groups upon reaching adulthood. ReproductionFemale brown hyenas are polyestrous and typically produce their first litter when they are two years old. They mate primarily from May to August, the gestation period lasting 97 days. Unlike aardwolves, female brown hyenas mate with nomadic males or the dominant male member of their own clan. Clan males display no resistance, and will assist the females in raising their cubs. Females give birth in dens, which are hidden in remote sand dunes far from the territories of spotted hyenas and lions. Mothers generally produce one litter every 20 months. Usually, only the dominant female breeds, but if two litters are born in the same clan, the mothers will nurse each other's cubs, though favoring their own. Litters usually consist of 1-5 cubs, which weigh 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lbs) at birth. Unlike spotted hyenas, brown hyenas are born with their eyes closed, and open them after eight days. Cubs leave their dens after four months. Also unlike spotted hyenas, all adult members of the clan will carry food back to the cubs. They are not fully weaned and do not leave the vicinity of their den until they reach 14 months of age. Dietary habitsBrown hyenas are primarily scavengers, the bulk of their diet consisting of carcasses killed by larger predators, though they may supplement their diet with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). However, brown hyenas are aggressive scavengers, frequently appropriating the kills of black-backed jackals, cheetahs, and leopards, including adult male leopards.Owens, Mark and Owens, Delia. Cry of the Kalahari.1984. pp. 133-5.\"Hyenas of the Kalahari\". Owens, Delia and Owens,Mark.

Cry of the Kalahari. 1984. pp. 133-5. sometimes, brown hyenas have been observed treeing leopards even when no kill was in contention.\"Hyenas of the Kalahari\". Owens, Delia and Owens,Mark. Natural History. 89(2):p50 (February 1980). In the Kalahari desert, brown hyenas are often the dominant mammalian carnivores present because of their dominance over the other predators listed above, and because of the scarcity of lions, spotted hyenas, and packs of African wild dogs. In areas where they may overlap, Brown hyenas may rarely be killed by spotted hyenas and lions.[1]Brown hyenas will cache excess food in shrubs or holes and recover it within 24 hours. Brown hyenas are poor hunters, and live prey makes up only a small proportion of their diet: in the southern Kalahari, species such as springhare, springbok lambs, bat-eared foxes and korhaan species make up only 4.2% of their overall diet,Mills, M.G.L. 1990. Kalahari hyaenas: the comparative behavioral ecology of two species. Unwin Hyman, London. while on the Namib coast, cape fur seal pups compose 2.9% of the brown hyenas dietary intake.Goss, R.A. 1986. The influence of food source on the behavioral ecology of brown hyaenas Hyaena brunnea in the Namib Desert. MSc thesis, University of Pretoria, Pretoria. In the Kalahari, brown hyenas are active 80% of the time at night searching for food in an area spanning 31.1\u00a0km (19.3\u00a0mi), with 54.4\u00a0km (33.8\u00a0mi) being recorded. Their powerful sense of smell allows them to track even old carcasses 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) downwind."}, {"description": "Brown hyenas can measure 86 to in head-and-body length, although they average 110 to. The height at the shoulder is 70 to and the tail is 25 to long.[1] (2011). Unlike the larger spotted hyena, there are no sizable differences between the sexes,The behavior guide to African mammals: including hoofed mammals, carnivores, primates by Richard Estes, published by the University of California Press, 1991 though males may be slightly larger than the females. The average adult male weighs 40.2 to, while the average female weighs 37.7 to.[2] (2011).[3] (2011). The normal upper weight limit for the species is 55 kg, although an occasional outsized specimen can weigh up to 67.6 to.[4] (2011). The coat is long and shaggy, particularly on the tail and back. The general fur color is dark brown, while the head is gray, the upper body tawny and the legs grey with dark horizontal stripes. Erectile hairs 305\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in length cover the neck and back. Brown hyenas have powerful jaws: young animals can crack the leg bones of springboks within five minutes of birth, though this ability deteriorates with age as their teeth gradually wear. The skulls of brown hyenas are larger than those of the more northern striped hyenas, and their dentition is more robust, indicating less generalised dietary adaptations. Brown hyenas possess an anal gland below the base of the tail, which produces a black and white paste. The gland has a groove, coated with a white secretion, which divides a pair of lobes which produce a black secretion. These secretions are deposited on grass stalks roughly every quarter mile of their feeding grounds, particularly around territorial borders."}]}

It is the largest of its family in Africa, and the only member of the genus Lycaon, which is distinguished from Canis by its fewer toes and dentition, which is highly specialised for a hypercarnivorous diet. It is classed as endangered by the IUCN, as it has disappeared from much of its original range. The current population has been estimated at roughly 39 subpopulations containing 6,600 adults, only 1,400 of which are fully grown. The decline of these populations is ongoing, due to habitat fragmentation, human persecution, and disease outbreaks.The African wild dog is a highly social animal, living in packs with separate dominance hierarchies for males and females. Uniquely among social carnivores, it is the females rather than the males that disperse from the natal pack once sexually mature, and the young are allowed to feed first on carcasses. The species is a specialised diurnal hunter of antelopes, which it catches by chasing them to exhaustion. Like other canids, it regurgitates food for its young, but this action is also extended to adults, to the point of being the bedrock of African wild dog social life. It has few natural predators, though lions are a major source of mortality, and spotted hyenas are frequent kleptoparasites.Although not as prominent in African folklore or culture as other African carnivores, it has been respected in several hunter-gatherer societies, particularly those of the predynastic Egyptians and the San people."}, {"description": "Social and reproductive behaviour The African wild dog has very strong social bonds, stronger than those of sympatric lions and spotted hyenas, thus solitary living and hunting is extremely rare in the species.Kingdon, Jonathan (1988). East African mammals: an atlas of evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part 1. University of Chicago Press. pp. 36\u201353. ISBN 0-226-43721-3. It lives in permanent packs consisting of 2\u201327 adults and yearling pups. The average pack size in Kruger National Park and the Masai Mara is 4\u20135 adults, while packs in Moremi and Selous contain an average of 8\u20139. However, larger packs have been observed, and temporary aggregations of hundreds of individuals may have gathered in response to the seasonal migration of vast springbok herds in Southern Africa.Nowak, Ronald M. Walker's Carnivores of the World. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 2005. p112. Males and females have separate dominance hierarchies, with the latter usually being led by the oldest female. Males may be led by the oldest male, but these can be supplanted by younger specimens, thus some packs may contain elderly former male pack leaders. The dominant pair typically monopolises breeding. The species differs from most other social species by the fact that males remain in the natal pack, while females disperse (a pattern also found in primates like gorillas, chimpanzees and red colobuses). Furthermore, males in any given pack tend to outnumber females 3:1. Dispersing females will join other packs and evict some of the resident females related to the other pack members, thus preventing inbreeding and allowing the evicted specimens to find new packs of their own and breed. Males rarely disperse, and when they do, they are invariably rejected by other packs already containing males. Although arguably the most social canid, the species lacks the elaborate facial expressions and body language found in the grey wolf, likely because of the African wild dog's less hierarchical social structure. Furthermore, while elaborate facial expressions are important for wolves in re-establishing bonds after long periods of separation from their family groups, they are not as necessary to African wild dogs, which remain together for much longer periods.African wild dog populations in East Africa appear to have no fixed breeding season, whereas those in Southern Africa usually breed during the April\u2013July period. During estrus, the female is closely accompanied by a single male, which keeps other members of the same sex at bay. The copulatory tie characteristic of mating in most canids has been reported to be absent or very brief (less than one minute) in L. pictus, possibly an adaptation to the prevalence of larger predators in its environment. The gestation period lasts 69\u201373 days, with the interval between each pregnancy being 12\u201314 months on average. The African wild dog produces more pups than any other canid, with litters containing around 6\u201316 pups, with an average of 10, thus indicating that a single female can produce enough young to form a new pack every year. Because the amount of food necessary to feed more than two litters would be impossible to acquire by the average pack, breeding is strictly limited to the dominant female, which may kill the pups of subordinates. After giving birth, the mother stays close to the pups in the den, while the rest of the pack hunts. She typically drives away pack members approaching the pups until the latter are old enough to eat solid food at 3\u20134 weeks of age. The pups leave the den at around the age of three weeks, and are suckled outside. The pups are weaned at the age of five weeks, at which point they are fed regurgitated meat by the other pack members. By seven weeks, the pups begin to take on an adult appearance, with noticeable lengthening in the legs, muzzle and ears. Once the pups reach the age of 8\u201310 weeks, the pack abandons the den, and the young follow the adults during hunts. The youngest pack members are permitted to eat first on kills, a privilege which ends once they become yearlings. Hunting and feeding behavioursThe African wild dog is a specialised pack hunter of common medium-sized antelopes. Like the cheetah, it is the only primarily diurnal African large predator. L. pictus hunts by approaching prey silently then chasing it in a pursuit clocking at 66 kmph for 10 to 60 minutes. The average chase typically only goes as far as 2\u00a0km, during which time the prey animal, if large, is repeatedly bitten on the legs, belly and anus until it stops running, while smaller prey is simply pulled down and torn apart. L. pictus hunting strategies differ according to prey, with wildebeest being rushed at in order to panic the herd and isolate a vulnerable individual, whereas territorial antelope species, which defend themselves by running in wide circles, are captured by cutting off their escape routes. Medium-sized prey is often killed in 2\u20135 minutes, whereas larger prey like wildebeest may take half an hour to pull down. Male wild dogs usually perform the task of grabbing dangerous prey, such as warthogs, by the nose. Small prey, like rodents, hares and birds are hunted singly, with dangerous prey like cane rats and porcupines being killed with a quick and well placed bite in order to avoid injury. Small prey is eaten entirely, while large animals are stripped of their meat and organs, with the skin, head, skeleton left intact. The African wild dog is a fast eater, with a pack being able to consume a Thompson's gazelle in 15 minutes. In the wild, the species' consumption rate is of 1.2\u20135.9\u00a0kg per African wild dog a day, with one pack of 17\u201343 specimens in East Africa having been recorded to kill three animals per day on average. Unlike most social predators, it will regurgitate food for adult, as well as young family members. Pups old enough to eat solid food are given first priority at kills, eating even before the dominant pair; subordinate adult dogs help feed and protect the pups.Nowak, Ronald M. Walker's Carnivores of the World. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 2005. p113.

Lizars, Edinburgh, p. 261-69The species was first described scientifically in 1820 by Coenraad Temminck, after having examined a specimen taken from the coast of Mozambique. He named the animal Hyaena picta, erroneously classifying it as a species of hyena. It was later recognised as a canid by Joshua Brookes in 1827, and renamed Lycaon tricolor. The root word of Lycaon is the Greek \u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 (lykaios), meaning 'wolf-like'. The specific epithet pictus (Latin for 'painted'), which derived from the original picta, was later returned to it, in conformity with the International Rules on Taxonomic Nomenclature.Bothma, J. du P. & Walker, C.

This preference is likely linked to the animal's hunting habits, which require open areas which do not obstruct vision or impede pursuit. Nevertheless, it will travel through scrub, woodland and montane areas in pursuit of prey. However, forest-dwelling populations of African wild dogs have been identified, including one in the Harenna Forest, a wet montane forest up to 2400m in altitude in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia.Dutson, Guy; and Sillero-Zuberi, Claudio. 2005. \"Forest-dwelling African wild dogs in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia.\" 8 (3):1-6. Accessed at: http://www.canids.org/canidnews/8/African_wild_dogs_in_Ethiopia.pdf There is at least one record of a pack being sighted on the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. In Zimbabwe, the species has been recorded at altitudes of 1,800 metres. DietIn East Africa, its most common prey is Thomson's gazelle, while in Central and Southern Africa it targets impala, reedbuck, kob, lechwe, and springbok. Its diet is not restricted to these animals though, as it will also hunt wildebeest, warthog, oribi, duiker, waterbuck, Grant's gazelle, zebra, bushbuck, ostrich, African buffalo (especially calves),http://www.arkive.org/african-wild-dog/lycaon-pictus/video-08a.html and smaller prey like dik-dik, hares, spring hares and cane rats. Certain packs in the Serengeti specialized in hunting zebras in preference to other prey.Malcolm, J.R. and Van Lawick, Hugo. 1975. \"Notes on wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) hunting zebras. Mammalia. 39: 231-240. One pack was recorded to occasionally prey on bat-eared foxes, rolling on the carcasses before eating them. L. pictus rarely scavenges, but has on occasion been observed to appropriate carcasses from spotted hyenas, leopards, and lions, as well as animals caught in snares. Enemies and competitors Lions dominate African wild dogs, and are a major source of mortality for both adults and pups.Woodroffe, R. & Ginsberg, J. R., eds. 1997. Past and Future Causes of Wild Dogs' Population Decline. In Rosie Woodroffe, Joshua Ginsberg & David MacDonald, eds., Status Survey and Conservation Plan: The African Wild Dog: 58\u201373. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group. Population densities of African wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. One pack reintroduced into Etosha National Park was destroyed by lions, and a population crash in lions in the Ngorongoro Crater during the 1960s resulted in an increase in African wild dog sightings, only for their numbers to decline once the lions recovered. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to African wild dogs.Schaller, G. B. (1972). The Serengeti lion: A study of predator-prey relations. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 188. ISBN 0-226-73639-3.Spotted hyenas are important kleptoparasites, and will follow packs of African wild dogs in order to appropriate their kills. They will typically inspect areas where African wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching African wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off with a piece of meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating African wild dog kills, though the latter's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of African wild dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although African wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, the relationship between the two species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas,Kruuk, H. (1972).

In one story, the animal is indirectly linked to the origin of death, as the hare is cursed by the moon to be forever hunted by African wild dogs after the former animal rebuffs the moon's promise to allow all living things to be reborn after death. Another story has the god Cagn taking revenge on the other gods by sending a group of men transformed into African wild dogs to attack them, though who won the battle is never revealed. The San of Botswana see the African wild dog as the ultimate hunter, and traditionally believe that shamans and medicine men can transform themselves into the animal. Some San hunters will smear African wild dog bodily fluids on their feet prior to a hunt, under the belief that doing so will gift them with the animal's boldness and agility. Nevertheless, the species does not figure prominently in San rock art, with the only notable example being a frieze in Mount Erongo showing a pack hunting two antelopes.De la Harpe R. & De la Harpe, P.

Females are generally 3\u20137% smaller than males. Compared to members of the genus Canis, the African wild dog is comparatively lean and tall, with outsized ears and lacking dewclaws. The middle two toepads are usually fused. Its dentition also differs from that of Canis by the degeneration of the last lower molar, the narrowness of the canines, and proportionately large premolars, which are the largest relative to body size than any other carnivore other than hyenas. The heel of the lower carnassial M1 is crested with a single blade-like cusp, which enhances the shearing capacity of the teeth and thus the speed at which prey can be consumed. This feature, termed \"trenchant heel\", is shared with two other canids: the Asian dhole and the South American bush dog. The skull is relatively shorter and broader than that of other canids.The fur of the African wild dog differs significantly from that of other canids, consisting entirely of stiff bristle-hairs with no underfur. It gradually loses its fur as it ages, with older specimens being almost naked. Colour variation is extreme, and may serve in visual identification, as African wild dogs can recognise each other at distances of 50\u2013100 metres. There is some geographic variation in coat colour, with north-east African specimens tending to be predominantly black with small white and yellow patches, while southern African ones are more brightly coloured, sporting a mix of brown, black and white coats. Much of the species' coat patterning occurs on the trunk and legs. There is little variation in facial markings, with the muzzle being black, gradually shading into brown on the cheeks and forehead. A black line extends up the forehad, turning blackish-brown on the back of the ears. A few specimens sport a brown teardrop shaped mark below the eyes. The back of the head and neck are either brown or yellow. A white patch occasionally occurs behind the forelegs, with some specimens having completely white forelegs, chests and throats. The tail is usually white at the tip, black in the middle and brown at the base. Some specimens lack the white tip entirely, or may have black fur below the white tip. These coat patterns are asymmetrical, with the left side of the body often having different markings from that of the right."}, {"description": "African wild dogs once ranged from the desert and mountainous areas of much of sub-Saharan Africa, being absent in the driest desert regions and lowland forests. The species has been largely exterminated in North and West Africa, and has been greatly reduced in number in Central Africa and northeast Africa. The majority of the species' population now occurs in Southern Africa and southern East Africa. Status North AfricaThe species is very rare in North Africa, and whatever populations remain may be of high conservation value, as they are likely to be genetically distinct from other L. pictus populations.Fanshawe, J. H., Ginsberg, J. R., Sillero-Zubiri, C. & Woodroffe, R., eds. 1997. The Status & Distribution of Remaining Wild Dog Populations. In Rosie Woodroffe, Joshua Ginsberg & David MacDonald, eds., Status Survey and Conservation Plan: The African Wild Dog: 11\u201356. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group. Country Status Distribution Although historically present, L. pictus is probably extinct, though may exist as a relict population in the south. As of 1997, the only recent reports come from the Teffedest Mountains. The species once occurred in the Mouydir Arah Mountains, but has disappeared, likely due to trapping and poisoning by Tuareg tribesmen. The last sighting in the Ahaggar National Park was in 1989. Probably not present. There was at least one unconfirmed sighting in 1992, and hunters living in the coastal areas of Western Sahara described a pack-hunting canid resembling L. pictus, though the identity of this animal is unconfirmed. West AfricaThe species is faring poorly in most of West Africa, with the only potentially viable population occurring in Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park. African wild dogs are occasionally sighted in other parts of Senegal, as well as in Guinea and Mali. Country Status Distribution L. pictus is most likely extinct, with a survey taken in 1990 indicating that locals thought that the species' continued survival in the country extremely unlikely. Parc W might hold the country's remaining L. pictus populations, though they were considered either declining or extinct in 1988. It may occur in declining numbers in Pendjari National Park. L. pictus is likely extinct, and widespread poverty prevents effective wildlife protection, despite the species' protected legal status. The last sightings of the animal occurred in 1985 in the Nazinga Game Ranch. It might still occur in the Arli National Park and the Como\u00e9 Province, but in low numbers. The most recent sighting occurred in 1995, on the northern border with Senegal. A small population may occur on the border area with Senegal. Although L. pictus is legally protected, it is probably extinct, as poaching is rampant and traditional attitudes toward predators are hostile. Although there have been no recent sightings, the species may still occur in Bui and Digya National Park. Hunters have reported the presence of L. pictus in the Kyabobo National Park, though the species is probably rare there. Although protected, the outlook for L. pictus in Guinea is poor. The species may occur in Badiar National park, as the park is adjacent to Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park, where L. pictus does occur. The most recent reports of the species include a sighting in 1991 along the Sankarani River and the deaths of three cows in 1996 in the Ndama F\u00f4ret Clas\u00e9e. There have been very few sightings, and the majority of the public hasn't heard of the species. Furthermore, its legal status is 'noxious'. The species may still occur in Como\u00e9 National Park (where it was last sighted in the late 1980s) and Marahou\u00e9 National Park (where the last sightings occurred during the 1970s). Liberian folklore makes no mention of L. pictus, thus indicating that the species has probably never been common in the area. The species may have once inhabited the north, but it is almost certainly rare there now. Although once widespread, L. pictus is now extremely rare in Mali. Although sighted in the For\u00eat Class\u00e9e de la Faya in 1959, the species was notably absent during a ground survey in the 1980s. The species may still occur in the south and west of the country, in the border regions with Senegal and Guinea. The species is almost certainly extinct, having been the subject of an extermination campaign during the 1960s. Although legally protected, L. pictus specimens were still shot by game guards as recently as 1979. Even if still present, the species' chances of survival are still low, due to regular droughts and loss of natural prey. L. pictus may still be present in low numbers in Parc W, in the extreme north and the Sirba region. Although legally protected, there are no resident L. lycaon populations in Nigeria, though vagrants from neighbouring countries occasionally appear. Factors inhibiting the species' recovery include a lack of effective protection and the drastic reduction of its prey. L. pictus may still persist in low numbers in Gashaka Gumti National Park, which is fairly close to Cameroon's Faro National Park, where the species still occurs, though there were no sightings in 1982\u20131986. L. pictus is occasionally reported in Chingurmi-Duguma National Park, with the most recent sighting having occurred in 1995. It is likely extinct in Kainji National Park and Borgu Game Reserve, as poaching is intense and the species has not been sighted since the 1980s. It is also extinct in Yankari National Park, with the last sighting having taken place in 1978. One confirmed sighting of a lone individual occurred in 1991 in the Lame Burra Game Reserve. Although only partially protected, L. pictus has increased in number since the 1990s in and around Niokolo-Koba National Park, thus making Senegal the best hope for the species in West Africa. L. pictus is present in increasing numbers in and around Niokolo-Koba National Park. The population in the Park was estimated to number 50-100 specimens in 1997. This population is monitored and studied by the IUCN's Canid Specialist Group, in conjunction with Senegal's Licaone Fund. Elsewhere, L. pictus is rare or extinct. The species is almost certainly extinct in Sierra Leone. L. pictus may have once been present in the northern savannah-woodland areas, as natives there have names for the species, and some unconfirmed sightings were made in the 1980s. There may be a small population in Outamba-Kilimi National Park, though there has only ever been one unconfirmed sighting. Despite receiving partial protection, L. pictus is probably extinct, and the country is severely lacking in prey species. It may occur in Fazao Mafakassa National Park, though in very low numbers. There are rumours of some small L. pictus packs taking refuge in caves on the mountain-sides of Mazala, Kpeya, and Kbidi. Central AfricaThe species is doing poorly in Central Africa, being extinct in Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo. The only viable populations occur in the Central African Republic, Chad and especially in Cameroon. Country Status Distribution The status of L. pictus in Cameroon is uncertain, though three packs occur in the north of the country, thus making it the only possible refuge for the species in Central Africa, along with those present in CAR and southern Chad. Historically, most conservation efforts were directed to rainforest reserves, where L. pictus does not occur, though efforts in the 1990s sought to redress this. Nevertheless, attitudes towards the species remain negative, with 25 specimens having been killed by professional hunters in northern Cameroon in 1991\u20131992, with a government quota of 65 specimens during the December 1995 \u2013 May 1996 hunting season. The species is still regularly sighted in and around Faro National Park, where four packs were recorded in 1997. It is present in smaller numbers in B\u00e9nou\u00e9 National Park, with several sightings having occurred in 1989 in the area between the two parks. L. pictus was sighted several times in and around Bouba Njida National Park in 1993. Although afforded total legal protection, CAR's L. pictus population has an uncertain future, though it is not far from the larger Cameroonian population. The species is very rare in Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park, with sightings having been reported as recently as 1992. It was once reportedly common in the Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Biosphere Reserve during the 1980s, though there were only two sightings in 1988\u20131990. There are no recent reports of L. pictus in Chad, and their legal status is unknown. If the species does occur, then the southern part of the country may form an important link between Cameroonian and CAR L. pictus populations. The species was already considered rare in the Ouadi Rim\u00e9-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve during the 1980s, and has not been sighted since. It is considered extinct in Zakouma National Park and the Bahr Salamat Faunal Reserve. There are no recent records of the species in Manda National Park and the Siniaka-Minia Faunal Reserve, though they once occurred in reasonable numbers during the 1980s. Although afforded total legal protection, L. pictus has not been sighted in the Republic of Congo since the 1970s. The species may have once inhabited Odzala National Park, though it occurred largely in unprotected areas, where it preyed on livestock and was subsequently exterminated by local pastoralists. Although the DRC once held a healthy L. pictus population, it has probably been extinct since the late 1990s. The most recent sighting occurred in 1986 in Upemba National Park. The species is extinct in Equatorial Guinea. There are no records of the species on the island of Bioko and R\u00edo Muni. L. pictus is probably extinct. The species was apparently once present in the Petit Loango National Park, but has not been sighted in years. East AfricaL. pictuss range in East Africa is patchy, having been eradicated in Uganda and much of Kenya. A small population occupies an area encompassing southern Ethiopia, South Sudan, northern Kenya, and probably northern Uganda. The species may still occur in small numbers in southern Somalia, and is almost certainly extinct in Rwanda, Burundi, and Eritrea. Nevertheless, it remains somewhat numerous in southern Tanzania, particularly in the Selous Game Reserve and Mikumi National Park, both of which are occupied by what could be Africa's largest L. pictus population. Country Status Distribution L. pictus was declared extinct in 1976. There are no reports in the large protected areas of Kibira and Ruvubu National Park, and the remaining areas are too small to support the species. There is no information pertaining to L. pictus in Djibouti. The only protected area, Day Forest National Park, is unlikely to support the species. L. pictus is probably extinct. There are no recent records, though reports from the early 1900s indicate that the species once occurred in some remote areas, including the future Yob Wildlife Reserve. L. pictus is rare in Ethiopia, despite total legal protection and the government's efforts at strengthening its network of protected areas. The species has been extirpated in three national parks, though it still occurs in the south of the country. The species was once occasionally recorded in and around Gambela National Park, though the last sighting occurred in 1987. It is frequently sighted in the Omo and Mago National Parks, with the most recent sighting in the former having occurred in 1995. Between 1992\u20131993, it was estimated that there were one or two packs in Omo and upt to five in Mago. It occasionally occurs in Bale Mountains National Park, though it is hampered by rabies and persecution by shepherds. Sporadic sightings have also occurred in the Awash and Nechisar National Parks. Three specimens were sighted in the Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary in 1996. Outside protected areas, the species has been reported in Jijiga and Filtu. Although widespread, the species receives only partial legal protection, and primarily occurs in unprotected areas, with no high population densities. L. pictus numbers have declined, and it has become locally extinct in many areas, with only 15 packs occurring throughout the entire country as of 1997. Local attitudes towards it are poor, and it is frequently shot in livestock areas. It is occasionally sighted in the southern part of the Lake Turkana National Parks and the surrounding Turkana County. Vagrant individuals are sometimes sighted at the border with Sudan, as well as in the northeast, around Mandera, Wajir, and Marsabit National Park. It is rarely encountered in the Samburu National Reserve, and has been absent from the Buffalo Springs National Reserve since the mid-1980s. It was observed twice in 1982\u20131983 in the Kora National Reserve. It is now absent from Mount Kenya, though it was reportedly common in the 1950s. L. pictus is probably extinct in Lake Nakuru National Park, and a fence erected around the park to protect rhinos prevents the species from recolonising the area. It was twice sighted outside Nairobi National Park, though it is regularly shot and snared there. The species disappeared from the Maasai Mara in 1991 after a disease outbreak. It may still be present in the Rift Valley Province and East and West Tsavo. It is still present in small numbers in the Lamu District, but is declining in the Dodori National Reserve, and may be absent in the Tana River Primate Reserve. Although legally protected, L. pictus is extinct in Rwanda, likely due to a disease outbreak. Modern Rwanda's overly high human population makes the country unsuitable for future L. pictus recolonisation, and a reintroduction project in 1989 was thwarted by the onset of the Rwandan Civil War. The species once occurred in high numbers in Akagera National Park, to the point of it being known as Le Parc aux Lycaons. A disease outbreak wiped out this population in 1983\u20131984. The ongoing Somali Civil War has made the outlook of L. pictus very poor in the country, with deforestation, poaching, drought, and over-grazing preventing the species from recovering, despite it being legally protected. The species may still be present in the north, though the last sighting occurred in 1982. It was once common in the Buloburde District before the late 1970s. A probably declining population may occur near the Jubba River. One pack was sighted in 1994 in Lag Badana National Park, which may be the best stronghold for the species in Somalia. As with all large carnivores, L. pictus populations fell drammatically during the Second Sudanese Civil War, though sightings have occurred in South Sudan. The species once occurred in the Sudd, though updates are lacking, and it is not afforded any legal protection in the area. It may be present in the Bangagai Game Reserve and Southern National Park. A pack was sighted in 1995 in Dinder National Park. Prospects in Tanzania are good for L. pictus, as the government imposed a moratorium on all hunting of the species, and it receives full legal protection. Although rare in the north, the south offers ideal habitat, as large tsetse fly populations prevent widespread human colonisation. The Selous Game Reserve and probably Ruaha National Park represent the best strongholds for the species in all of Africa. The species is common in the Selous Game Reserve, where about 880 adult specimens were estimated in 1997. It is also present in neighbouring Mikumi National Park, and has been sighted in other nearby areas. L. pictus may no longer occur in Serengeti National Park, with only 34 individuals being counted in late 1990. It is occasionally seen in the Kilimanjaro and Arusha National Parks. It is unlikely that Uganda has a resident L. pictus population, as the species was heavily persecuted after a 1955 directive to shoot it on sight. Vagrant specimens occasionally enter the country via Tanzania and South Sudan. A survey taken in 1982\u20131992 showed that the species was likely extirpated in Uganda, though sightings in some scattered areas may indicate that L. pictus is recolonising the country. Single individuals and small packs were sighted in Murchison Falls National Park, and were seen several times in the Northern Karamoja Controlled Hunting Area in 1994. Southern AfricaSouthern Africa contains numerous viable L. pictus populations, one of which encompasses northern Botswana, northeastern Namibia and western Zimbabwe. In South Africa, around 400 specimens occur in the country's Kruger National Park. Zambia holds two large populations, one in Kafue National Park, and another in the Luangwa Valley. However, the species is rare in Malawi, and probably extinct in Angola and Mozambique. Country Status Distribution Although L. pictus is legally protected, the Angolan Civil War prevented the collection of data, and there have been no reports of the species since 1990. The species was once found throughout Angola's protected areas, though it went into decline during the mid-1970s. It may still occur in the Cuando Cubango Province, where vagrants may arrive from Zambia and Namibia, though the population is probably unviable. The species' prospects in Botswana are hopeful, with the north of the country probably holding the largest L. pictus populations in all of Africa. Nevertheless, it receives only partial protection, and farmers are permitted to shoot it in defence of livestock. The species' most important stronghold in Botswana is Ngamiland, which includes the Okavango Delta, the Moremi Game Reserve, and Chobe National Park. In 1997, at least 42 packs containing 450\u2013500 individuals were estimated in the area. L. pictus is scarce elsewhere. Although rare, L. pictus is legally protected, and may only be taken by government hunters and private citizens with ministerial permits. By the 1990s, it was regularly sighted in Kasungu National Park. The species was regularly reported in Kasungu National Park in the 1990s, where there were 18 sightings in 1991 alone. It occurs in low numbers in Nyika National Park and the Mwabvi Wildlife Reserve. The outlook of L. pictus in Mozambique is poor. The species underwent a rapid reduction in numbers after the Mozambican War of Independence in 1975, reaching the verge of extinction by 1986. Nevertheless, it regularly enters the country via Kruger National Park in neighbouring South Africa. L. pictus was once widely distributed in the remote and protected areas of the country, though it was declared extinct in western Manica, endangered in Tete and Zambezi, and extinct in Nampula. The species still occurred in the Rovuma and Lugenda River regions in 1986, and a pack with pups was sighted in Cahora Bassa in 1996. Although heavily persecuted by farmers throughout the country, the species has full legal protection and is doing well in the northeastern part of the country. The species is restricted to the northeast, being extinct elsewhere. The northeastern population is probably connected to that in northern Botswana. South Africa's L. pictus population is listed as 'specially protected' in the South African Red Data Book, and it has a stronghold in Kruger National Park, which held 350\u2013400 specimens in the mid-1990s. There have been several attempts to reintroduce the species elsewhere, though only two of these attempts proved successful, and the resulting populations were not large enough to be viable. The species occurs in three regions: the Northern Cape, Kruger National Park, and KwaZulu-Natal. The Kruger population numbers at around 375\u2013450 specimens, though they face pressure from lions and spotted hyenas, and are sometimes shot or snared outside Park boundaries. Six specimens were released into the Madikwe Game Reserve during the 1990s, though the reserve is too small to sustain a large population. In KwaZulu-Natal, the species is present in Hluhluwe\u2013iMfolozi Park, where it was reintroduced during the early 1980s. This population has fluctuated since the reintroduction, and local attitudes towards it vary from hostile to favourable. There appears to be no resident population in the country. L. pictus has only been sighted once, when a pack was observed to kill a blesbok in December 1992, staying in the area for two weeks before disappearing. Although once extensively persecuted, the species has total legal protection in Zambia, and can only be hunted after purchasing a costly licence from the Minister of Tourism. L. pictus remains widespread and occurs in most protected areas, which are large and hold suitable habitat and prey. Nevertheless, populations have declined since 1990. The species was present in declining numbers in Lusenga Plain National Park in 1988, and have not been reported there since. Sightings have occurred in Sumbu National Park, where the species is likely declining due to disease. Small numbers were recorded in North Luangwa National Park in 1994, and are occasionally seen in the adjoining Musalangu and Lumimba Game Management Areas. It is often sighted in South Luangwa National Park, where it was previously declining due to an anthrax outbreak. Occasional sightings also occur in the Lupande Game Management Area, Luambe National Park, Lukusuzi National Park, and the Lower Zambezi National Park. Zimbabwe holds viable L. pictus populations, which were estimated to consist of 310\u2013430 individuals in 1985. The population increased during the 1990s, with a survey taken in 1990\u20131992 having estimated the population to be made up of 400\u2013600 animals. The species is legally protected, and can only be hunted with a permit, which has only been given once between 1986\u20131992. The bulk of L. pictus populations in Zimbabwe occurs in and around Hwange National Park, including Victoria Falls National Park, Matetsi and Deka Safari Areas, and Kazuma Pan National Park. Collectively, these areas contain an estimated 35 packs made up of 250\u2013300 individuals."}, {"description": "The evolution of the African wild dog was once poorly understood, due to the scarcity of fossil finds. One proposed ancestral genus was Xenocyon, which lived throughout Eurasia, from Germany to Japan, as well as in Africa from the Early Pleistocene to the early Middle Pleistocene. The species X. falconeri shared the African wild dog's absent first metacarpal (dewclaw), though its dentition was still relatively unspecialised. This connection was however rejected, as X. falconeri's missing metacarpal was a poor indication of phylogenetic closeness to the African wild dog, and the dentition was too different to imply ancestry. A more likely ancestral candidate is the Plio-Pleistocene L. sekowei of South Africa, on the basis of skull shape and tooth morphology, which shows the same adaptations to a hypercarnivorous diet as the modern species. L. sekowei had not yet lost the first metacarpal absent in L. pictus, and was more robust than the modern species, having 10% larger teeth. Paleontologist George G. Simpson placed L. pictus in the subfamily Simocyoninae, along with Cuon alpinus and Speothos venaticus, on the basis of all three species having similarly trenchant carnassials. This grouping was disputed by Juliet Clutton-Brock, who argued that other than dentition, there were too few similarities between the three species to warrant classifying them in a single subfamily.Clutton-Brock, J., Corbet, G.G., and Hills, M. (1976). \"A review of the family Canidae, with a classification by numerical methods.\" Bull. Brit. Mus. Nat. Hist. 29, 119\u2013199. The species' molecular genetics indicate that, although it is far removed from the genus Canis, it is nonetheless more closely related to it than to other canid lineages. Phylogenetic studies place L. pictus and Cuon alpinus into a monophyletic clade alongside some members of the Canis genus, including C. simensis, C. aureus, C. latrans, and C. lupus, while the more basal C. adustus and C. mesomelas are excluded from it. Subspecies, five subspecies are recognised by MSW3: Subspecies Image Trinomial authority Description Range Synonyms Cape wild dogL. p. pictusNominate subspecies Temminck, 1820 Specimens inhabiting the Cape are characterised by the large amount of orange-yellow fur overlapping the black, the partially yellow backs of the ears, the mostly yellow underparts, and a number of whitish hairs on the throat mane. Those in Mozambique are distinguished by the almost equal development of yellow and black on both the upper and underparts of the body, as well as having less white fur than the Cape form.Bryden, H.

It was once thought that East African and Southern African L. pictus populations were genetically distinct, based on a small number of samples. More recent studies with a larger number of samples showed that there has been extensive intermixing between East African and Southern African populations in the past. Some unique nuclear and mitochondrial alleles are found in Southern African and north-eastern African populations, with a transition zone encompassing Botswana, Zimbabwe and south-eastern Tanzania between the two. The West African L. pictus population may possess a unique haplotype, thus possibly constituting a truly distinct subspecies.Edwards, J. (2009).

Afrikanische Wildhunde jagen in der Regel zwei Mal t\u00e4glich. Die erste Jagd findet gew\u00f6hnlich zwischen sechs und acht Uhr morgens statt. Die zweite liegt meistens zwischen f\u00fcnf und sieben Uhr abends. Das jagende Rudel wird vom Alpha-M\u00e4nnchen angef\u00fchrt. Die Beute wird nicht nach dem Geruch, sondern auf Sicht aufgesp\u00fcrt. Afrikanische Wildhunde sind als Hundeartige ausdauernde Hetzj\u00e4ger, die ihre Beute \u00fcber drei bis f\u00fcnf Kilometer verfolgen k\u00f6nnen. Bei der Hetzjagd werden Geschwindigkeiten von 55 Kilometern pro Stunde erreicht. Ist das fl\u00fcchtende Beutetier erm\u00fcdet, wird es vom Alpha-Tier an den Hinterbeinen gepackt; die anderen Hunde holen dann auf und zerrei\u00dfen das Tier bei lebendigem Leibe. Ein T\u00f6tungsbiss wird nicht angesetzt.Die Erfolgsrate der Jagden liegt bei fast 90 %. Bevorzugte Beutetiere sind Gazellen, Impalas und andere Antilopen sowie Warzenschweine. Dagegen werden Zebras so gut wie nie attackiert, da die Wildhunde offenbar Hufschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcrchten. Die t\u00fcchtigen J\u00e4ger verschm\u00e4hen auch Hasen, Nagetiere, Jungv\u00f6gel und andere Kleintiere nicht, auf die sie bei ihren Streifz\u00fcgen sto\u00dfen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen hundeartigen J\u00e4gern wie Wolf und Kojote werden bei der Verteilung der Beute zuerst der Nachwuchs und kranke Tiere des Rudels versorgt. Dieses Verhalten l\u00e4sst sich durch den Umstand erkl\u00e4ren, dass der Afrikanische Wildhund kein Top-Pr\u00e4dator in seinem Lebensraum ist. Die evolution\u00e4re Strategie dahinter ist das Prinzip der vielen Starken.

The head is foreshortened in both sexes because of the very short, down-curved muzzle, and small nose, which extends slightly beyond the mouth in females and moderately in males. The pelage is thick and luxuriant, with a dense underfur in a creamy color. The underfur is obscured by the longer guard hairs, although it is partially visible when the animals are wet. Features of both fore and hind flippers are unique and diagnostic of the species. Fur is absent on the top of the fore flippers and an abrupt \"clean line\" is seen across the wrist where the fur ends. The hind flippers are proportionately the longest in any otariid because of extremely long, cartilaginous extensions on all of the toes. Small claws are on digits 2\u20134, well back from the flap-like end of each digit. The ear pinnae are long and conspicuous, and naked of dark fur at the tips in older animals. The mystacial vibrissae can be very long, and regularly extend beyond the ears. Adults have all white vibrissae, juveniles and subadults have a mixture of white and black vibrissae, including some that have dark bases and white ends, and pups and yearlings have all black vibrissae. The eyes are proportionately large and conspicuous, especially on females, subadults, and juveniles.Adult males are stocky in build, and have enlarged (thick and wide) necks. A mane of coarse, longer guard hairs extends from the lower neck to the shoulders. and covers the nape, neck, chest, and upper back. While the skulls of adult males are large and robust for their overall size, their heads appear short because of the combination of a short muzzle, and the backs of the head behind the ear pinnae being obscured by the enlarged necks. Adult males have abrupt foreheads formed by the elevation of the crown from development of the sagittal crests, and thicker fur of the mane on the top of their heads.Canine teeth are much longer and have a greater diameter in adult males than those found on adult females, and this relationship holds to a lesser extent at all ages. Adult females, subadults, and juveniles are moderate in build. Distinguishing the sexes is difficult until about age five. The body is modest in size and the neck, chest, and shoulders are sized in proportion with the torso. Adult females and subadults have more complex and variable coloration than adult males. They are dark silver-gray to charcoal above. The flanks, chest, sides, and underside of the neck, often forming a chevron pattern in this area, are cream to tan with rusty tones. Variable cream to rust-colored areas are on the sides and top of the muzzle, chin, and as a \"brush stroke\" running backwards under the eye. In contrast, adult males are medium gray to black, or reddish to dark brown all over. Their manes can have variable amounts of silver-gray or yellowish tinting on the guard hairs. Pups are blackish at birth, with variable oval areas of buff on the sides, in the axillary area, and on the chin and sides of the muzzle. After three to four months, pups molt to the color of adult females and subadults.Males can be as large as 2.1 m and 270\u00a0kg. Females can be up to 1.5 m and weigh 50\u00a0kg or more.

Identified fish prey include hake, herring, lantern fish, capelin, pollock, and mackerel. Their feeding behavior is primarily solitary.Northern fur seals are preyed upon primarily by sharks and killer whales. Occasionally, very young animals are eaten by Steller sea lions. Occasional predation on live pups by arctic foxes has also been observed.Due to very high densities of pups on reproductive rookeries and the early age at which mothers begin their foraging trips, mortality can be relatively high. Consequently, pup carcasses are important in enriching the diet of many scavengers, in particular gulls and arctic foxes."}, {"description": "The northern fur seal is found in the north Pacific \u2013 its southernmost reach is a line that runs roughly from the southern tip of Japan to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea.Waerebeek, K.

Thewissen), Academic Press; 2nd edition, (2008) An estimated 1.1 million northern fur seals occur across the range, of which roughly half breed on the Pribilof Islands in the east Bering Sea. Another 200\u2013250 thousand breed on the Commander Islands in the west Bering Sea, some 100,000 breed on the Tyulen'i Islands off the coast of Sakhalin in the southwest Sea of Okhotsk, and another 60\u201370 thousand in the central Kuril Islands in Russia. Smaller rookeries (around 5,000 animals) are found on Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian Chain and San Miguel Island in the Channel Island group off the coast of California. Recent evidence from stable isotope analysis of Holocene fur seal bone collagen (\u03b413C and \u03b415N) indicates prior to the maritime fur trade, it was more common for these animals to breed at local rookeries in British Columbia, California, and likely along much of the northwest coast of North America.During the winter, northern fur seals display a net movement southward, with animals from Russian rookeries regularly entering Japanese and Korean waters in the Sea of Japan and Alaskan animals moving along the central and eastern Pacific to British Columbia, Canada and as far south as Baja California.The northern fur seal's range overlaps almost exactly with that of Steller sea lions; occasional cohabitation occurs at reproductive rookeries, notably in the Kurils, the Commander Islands, and Tyulen'i Islands. The only other fur seal found in the Northern Hemisphere is the Guadalupe fur seal which overlaps slightly with the northern fur seal's range in California."}, {"description": "Seals enter breeding rookeries in May. Generally, older males (10 years and older) return first and compete for prime breeding spots on the rookeries. They remain on the rookery, fasting throughout the duration of the breeding season. The females come somewhat later, and give birth shortly thereafter. Like all other otariids, northern fur seals are polygynous, with some males breeding with up to 50 females in a single breeding season. Unlike Steller sea lions, with which they share habitat and some breeding sites, northern fur seals are possessive of individual females in their harem, often aggressively competing with neighboring males for females.R. Gentry: Behavior and Ecology of the Northern Fur Seal. Princeton University Press, 1998 ISBN 0-691-03345-5 Deaths of females as a consequence of these conflicts have been recorded, though the males themselves are rarely seriously injured. Young males unable to acquire and maintain a territory of a harem typically aggregate in neighboring \"haulouts\", occasionally making incursions into the reproductive sections of the rookery in an attempt to displace an older male. After remaining with their pups for the first eight to ten days of their lives, females begin foraging trips lasting up to a week. These trips last for about four months before weaning, which happens abruptly, typically in October. Most of the animals on a rookery enter the water and disperse towards the end of November, typically migrating southward. Breeding site fidelity is generally high for fur seal females, though young males might disperse to other existing rookeries, or occasionally find new haulouts.Peak mating occurs somewhat later than peak birthing from late June to late July. As with many other otariids, the fertilized egg undergoes delayed implantation: after the blastocyst stage occurs, development halts and implantantion occurs four months after fertilization. In total, gestation lasts around a year, such that the pups born in a given summer are the product of the previous year's breeding cycle."}, {"description": "Recently, concern about the status of fur seal populations has increased, particularly in the Pribilof Islands, where pup production has decreased about 50% since the 1970s, with a continuing drop of about 6\u20137% per year. This has caused them to be listed as \"vulnerable\" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and has led to an intensified research program into their behavioral and foraging ecology. Possible causes are increased predation by killer whales, competition with fisheries, and climate change effects, but to date, no scientific consensus has been reached. The IUCN (2008) lists the species as globally threatened under the category \"vulnerable\". Fur tradeNorthern fur seals have been a staple food of native northeast Asian and Alaskan Inuit peoples for thousands of years. The arrival of Europeans to Kamchatka and Alaska in the 17th and 18th centuries, first from Russia and later from North America, was followed by a highly extractive commercial fur trade. The commercial fur trade was accelerated in 1786, when Gavriil Pribylov discovered St. George Island, a key rookery of the seals. An estimated 2.5 million seals were killed from 1786 to 1867. This trade led to a decline in fur seal numbers. Restrictions were first placed on fur seal harvest on the Pribilof Islands by the Russians in 1834. Shortly after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the U.S. Treasury was authorized to lease sealing privileges on the Pribilofs, which were granted somewhat liberally to the Alaska Commercial Company. From 1870 to 1909, pelagic sealing proceeded to take a significant toll on the fur seal population, such that the Pribilof population, historically numbering on the order of millions of individuals, reached a low of 216,000 animals in 1912.Significant harvest was more or less arrested with the signing of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 by Great Britain (on behalf of Canada), Japan, Russia, and the United States. The Convention of 1911 remained in force until the onset of hostilities among the signatories during World War II, and is also notable as the first international treaty to address the conservation of wildlife. A successive convention was signed in 1957 and amended by a protocol in 1963. \"The international convention was put into effect domestically by the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-702)\", said an Interior Department review of the history.Baker, R.C., F.

Im sp\u00e4ten 18. Jahrhundert wurden die gro\u00dfen Seeb\u00e4renkolonien im Nordpazifik entdeckt. W\u00e4hrend sich die Seeb\u00e4ren im Winter zerstreuten, konnten Robbenj\u00e4ger im Sommer einfach an den K\u00fcsten anlegen und Tausende von Robben problemlos abschlachten. Zu dieser Zeit gab es etwa 1,5 bis 2 Millionen Seeb\u00e4ren auf den Kommandeurinseln, 2 bis 2,5 Millionen auf den Pribilof Islands, und Hunderttausende mehr auf anderen Inseln entlang der Westk\u00fcste Nordamerikas. Anfangs wurden die Best\u00e4nde nicht gef\u00e4hrdet, da die russische Regierung die Fangzahlen einschr\u00e4nkte und zum Beispiel das T\u00f6ten junger M\u00e4nnchen verbot. Als Alaska 1867 durch die USA aufgekauft wurde, fielen solche Restriktionen weg. Allein in den zwei Jahren 1868 und 1869 wurden 329.000 Seeb\u00e4ren auf den Pribilof Islands get\u00f6tet. Zudem wurden die Robben auf See harpuniert. Um 1900 waren die Herden auf den Kurilen vernichtet, und auf den Kommandeurinseln sowie Tyuleniy waren nur noch wenige Einzeltiere \u00fcbrig. Nur auf den Pribilof Islands gab es mit 130.000 bis 300.000 Tieren noch eine nennenswerte Population.In der 1911 zwischen den USA, Russland, Japan und Kanada geschlossenen North Pacific Fur Seal Convention wurden endlich Beschr\u00e4nkungen eingef\u00fchrt. Bis 1917 wurde jede Seeb\u00e4renjagd verboten, f\u00fcr die Zeit danach wurde eine j\u00e4hrliche Quote von 40.000 legal get\u00f6teten Seeb\u00e4ren festgelegt. Das Harpunieren auf See wurde ganz untersagt. Durch diese Ma\u00dfnahme stieg der Bestand bis 1940 wieder auf 2,5 Millionen Seeb\u00e4ren an.Seit den 1940ern nehmen die Best\u00e4nde wieder ab, wenn auch allm\u00e4hlich und nicht mehr so drastisch wie einst. Es findet zwar eine geografische Ausbreitung statt, doch die gro\u00dfen Kolonien auf den Inseln im Nordpazifik werden von Jahr zu Jahr kleiner und sind heute etwa halb so gro\u00df wie in den 1940ern. Auch der vollst\u00e4ndige Stopp des kommerziellen Fangs (seit 1983) konnte diesen Trend nicht umkehren. Verantwortlich ist vermutlich die \u00dcberfischung des Beringmeers, durch die den Seeb\u00e4ren die Nahrungsgrundlage entzogen wird.

They are the most common bats seen in the rainforest, as they often roost on the outside of large trees. They are insectivores and use echolocation calls through the mouth to track their prey. The long nose and upper lip are highly mobile and can shift upward to enlarge the mouth opening. The term \"sac-winged\" refers to small pouches on the wings of S. bilineata. These sacs are used by males to attract females and to mark their harem territory. During daily grooming, males will fill these sacs with drops of urine and glandular secretions. During displays for females, the male will hover in front of the female and fan her vigorously to expose her to the scent of the mixture in the wing sacs. Males will also shake the contents of the sac towards bats outside of the male's harem territory to warn off intruders. Microbial fermentation in the sac may produce identifiable sent signals. pdfSac-wing pups have been recorded vocalizing various calls and sounds in a jumbled context. For example, a female pup will give the male trill of courting followed by echolocation clicks then adult territorial challenges. These mixed-up vocalizations have been equated with human infant babbling and mispronounced songs of young birds. This is the first example of mammal babbling outside of the primate order."}]}

By the classical age they were apparently considered a characteristic animal of Scythia, judging from the historian Strabo's description of an animal called the \"Kolos\" that was \"between the deer and ram in size\" and was (understandably but wrongly) believed to drink through its nose. At the beginning of the 18th century, it was still distributed from the shores of the Black Sea, the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and the northern edge of the Caucasus into Dzungaria and Mongolia.After a rapid decline they were nearly completely exterminated in the 1920s, but they were able to recover. By 1950, two million of them were found in the steppes of the USSR. Their population fell drastically following the collapse of the USSR due to uncontrolled hunting and demand for horns in Chinese medicine. At one point, some conservation groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, encouraged the hunting of this species, as its horn was presented as an alternative to that of a rhinoceros.Today, the populations have again shrunk enormously \u2014 as much as 95% in 15 years, \u2014 and the saiga is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. An estimated total number of 50,000 saigas survive today in Kalmykia, three areas of Kazakhstan and in two isolated areas of Mongolia.

However, in May 2010, an estimated 12,000 of the 26,000 Saiga population in the Ural region of Kazakhstan have been found dead. Although the deaths are currently being ascribed to pasteurellosis, an infectious disease that strikes the lungs and intestines, the underlying trigger remains to be identified.Kazakhstan in November 2010 reaffirmed a ban on hunting saiga antelopes, and extended this ban until 2021, as the Central Asian nation seeks to save the endangered species.The Mongolian saiga (S. t. mongolica) is found in a small area in western Mongolia around the Sharga and Mankhan Nature Reserves.Currently, only the Moscow Zoo and Askania-Nova keep saigas.

Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised that all of this variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking. Both Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n and Camille Arambourg promoted an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurt\u00e9n focussed his arguments on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed the possibility of an Indo-Ethiopian origin.Gilbert, W. Henry; Asfaw, Berhane (2008), Homo erectus: pleistocene evidence from the Middle Awash, Ethiopia, Volume 1 of Middle Awash series, University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-25120-2 This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis.Ficarelli, G.,; D. Torre. (1970), Remarks on the taxonomy of hyaenids. Palaeontographia Italica 66:13\u201333. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude the possibility of an Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3\u20131.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and a separation of African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, with the exception of the leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.Rohland, N, Pollack, JL, Nagel, D, Beauval, C, Airvaux J, Paabo, S & Hofreiter, M, 2005. The population history of extant and extinct hyenas. Mol. Biol. Evol,. 22: 2435\u20132443.The ancestors of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The ancestors of the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, as is the case for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females.Watts, Heather E.; Tanner, Jamie B.; Lundrigan, Barbara L.; Holekamp, Kay E.. Post-weaning maternal effects and the evolution of female dominance in the spotted hyena. Proceedings of The Royal Society, Biological Sciences, 2009; Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As there is no evidence of environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.Kurt\u00e9n, Bj\u00f6rn (1988) On evolution and fossil mammals, Columbia University Press, pp. 238\u2013242, ISBN 0-231-05868-3"}, {"description": "Cultural depictions and perceptions In prehistory The spotted hyena (cave hyena subspecies) is depicted in a few examples of Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and is depicted in profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ari\u00e8ge shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal\u2019s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.The relative scarcity of hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised to be due to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.Spassov N.; Stoytchev T. 2004. The presence of cave hyaena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) in the Upper Palaeolithic rock art of Europe. Historia naturalis bulgarica, 16: 159\u2013166. In Africa In Africa, the spotted hyena is usually portrayed as an abnormal and ambivalent animal, considered to be sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It is often difficult to know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.J\u00fcrgen W. Frembgen, \"The Magicality of the Hyena: Beliefs and Practices in West and South Asia, Asian Folklore Studies, vol. 57 (1998): 331\u2013344.In the culture of the Mbugwe in Tanzania, the spotted hyena is linked to witchcraft. According to Mbugwe folklore, every witch possesses one or more hyenas, which are referred to as \"night cattle\" and are branded with an invisible mark. It is said that all hyenas are owned by witches, and that truly wild hyenas are non-existent. Lactating female spotted hyenas are said to be milked by their owners every night to make hyena butter, and are further used as mounts. When a witch acquires a hyena mount, he rides it to distant lands in order to bewitch victims and return safely home before morning. The Mbugwe consider killing hyenas to be dangerous, as the bond between the hyena and its owner is very strong, and will likely result in the witch seeking retribution. In order to obviate this danger, a killed hyena usually has its ears, tail and front legs cut off and buried, as these are the parts which are supposed to be marked by the witches' brand.Middleton, John; Winter, E. H. (2004). Witchcraft and Sorcery in East Africa, Routledge, pp. 165\u2013167, ISBN 0-415-33073-4 In the Mtwara Region of Tanzania, it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will likely grow up to be a thief. In the same area, hyena faeces are believed to enable a child to walk at an early age, thus it is not uncommon in that area to see children with hyena dung wrapped in their clothes.The Kaguru of Tanzania and the Kujamaat of Southern Senegal view hyenas as inedible and greedy hermaphrodites. A mythical African tribe called the Bouda is reputed to house members able to transform into hyenas.Glickman, Stephen (1995). \"The Spotted Hyena from Aristotle to the Lion King: Reputation is Everything \u2013 In the Company of Animals\", Social Research, Volume 62 A similar myth occurs in Mansoa, Guinea-Bissau. These \"werehyenas\" are executed when discovered, but do not revert to their human form when killed. In Khoikhoi mythology, the spotted hyena is often the butt of the jackal's tricks. Gogo folklore links the spotted hyena to the origin of death; in one tale, the hyena prevents humanity from achieving immortality, thus ensuring it can continue to eat corpses. A similar tale is present among the Meru. In their narrative, the supreme god Murungu sent a mole to inform humanity that they would be reborn after death. Fearing this would deprive it of corpses to eat, the hyena prevents the mole from ever delivering the message. Madi and Nuer mythology links the spotted hyena to the separation between heaven and earth; at one time, humanity kept in contact with the Creator in the sky via a cowhide rope, which was subsequently severed by a hungry hyena.Lynch, Patricia Ann (2004) African mythology A to Z, Infobase Publishing, pp. 47\u201348, ISBN 0-8160-4892-4 The spotted hyena is a sacred totem animal for some Pedi tribes, with the skin often being used as robes by chieftains and their bones as divining instruments.Quin, P.J. 1959. Food abd feeding habits of the Pedi. Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press, p. 125. According to the doctrine of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, hyenas are unclean animals which represent sexual deviancy and lawlessness. The Egyptian Saint abba (Father) Matewos of Asfoni was associated with hyenas; one fable tells of how he rescued a cub trapped in a pit, and had his feet licked in gratitude by its mother. In Ethiopian folklore, an albino hyena called the \"King of Hyenas\" is ascribed great power. Some ethnic groups in Ethiopia associate themselves with hyenas; the Gurage traditionally believe that their ancestors migrated from Arabia to Ethiopia using hyenas as mounts. In Dorze tradition, the highest Demu\u1e63a-priests have the ability to control hyenas, and will send them to punish defaulting debtors.Uhlig, Siegbert (2007) Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, Volume 3 of Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, ISBN 3-447-05607-XSpotted hyenas feature prominently in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal the end of the \u00e8f\u00e8 ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Kor\u00e8 cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.Bierbaum, Bernd (2011) In Ethiopia, BoD \u2013 Books on Demand, ISBN 3844858849 In Western culture Traditional Western beliefs about the spotted hyena can be traced back to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which described the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.The author of the Physiologus, who infused pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching, reactivated the myth that the hyena is a hermaphrodite. The author compared the species to \"double-minded men\" who are neither \"man nor woman, that is, neither faithful nor unfaithful\". He further states that \"The sons of Israel are like this animal since in the beginning they served the living God but later, given over to pleasure and lust, they adored idols.\" The bestiaries of the Middle Ages embraced the Physiologuss descriptions, but further elaborated on the animal's necrophagous habits. These bestiaries almost invariably depict hyenas feeding on human corpses. These illustrations were largely based on the descriptions given by Aristotle and Pliny, though the animals have no spots or other bodily markings, thus making it unlikely that the authors had ever seen hyenas first-hand.During the 15th and 16th centuries, travellers to Africa provided further descriptions of the species. Leo Africanus repeated some of the old concepts on the hyena, with the addition of describing its legs and feet as similar to those of men. In 1551, Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner rejected the belief of the hyena's hermaphroditism, and theorised that it originated from confusion over an androgynous fish bearing the same name. He adds three other animals within the category of hyenas, including an Ethiopian quadruped named \"Crocotta\", which was thought to be a hybrid between a hyena and a lioness. Sir Thomas Browne also argued against the hyena's supposed hermaphroditism, stating that all animals follow their own \"Law of Coition\", and that a hermaphrodite would transgress this. Sir Walter Raleigh, in an attempt to rationalise how Noah's Ark could have fitted all extant species of animal, wrote that hyenas were hybrids between foxes and wolves which originated after the Great Flood. References to the spotted hyena's vocalisations are referenced in numerous contemporary examples of English literature, including Shakespeare's As You Like It and George Chapman's Eastward Ho. John Milton, in his Samson Agonistes, compares the species to Delila.Natural historians of the 18th and 19th century rejected stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised the differences between the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character,Mcpherson, James. The good, the bad and the hyena. suzieszterhas.com and another \u2013 who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas - suggested boycotting the film.Frank, Laurence D. (May 2006). Girl Power, African Geographic Livestock predationWhen targeting livestock, the spotted hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas in the southern parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region preferentially target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The rate at which the species targets livestock may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where livestock is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences. Attacks on humans and grave desecrationLike most mammalian predators, the spotted hyena is typically shy in the presence of humans, and has the highest flight distance (up to 300 metres) among African carnivores. However, this distance is reduced during the night, when hyenas are known to follow people closely. Although spotted hyenas do prey on humans in modern times, such incidences are rare. However, attacks on humans by spotted hyenas are likely to be underreported.Begg, Colleen; Begg, Kieth; Muemedi, Oscar (2007) Preliminary data on human \u2013 carnivore conflict in Niassa National Reserve, Mozambique, particularly fatalities due to lion, spotted hyaena and crocodile, SGDRN (Sociedade para a Gest\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento da Reserva do Niassa Mo\u00e7ambique) Man-eating spotted hyenas tend to be very large specimens; a pair of man-eating hyenas, responsible for killing 27 people in Mlanje, Malawi, in 1962, were weighed at 72\u00a0kg (159\u00a0lb) and 77\u00a0kg (170\u00a0lb) after being shot.Kruuk, Hans (2002) Hunter and hunted: relationships between carnivores and people Cambridge University Press, pp. 64\u201365, ISBN 0-521-89109-4 Victims of spotted hyenas tend to be women, children and sick or infirm men, and there are numerous cases of biologists in Africa being forced up trees in order to escape them. Attacks occur most commonly in September, when many people sleep outdoors, and bush fires make the hunting of wild game difficult for hyenas.In 1903, Hector Duff wrote of how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba district of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack them when they opened their doors. In 1908\u201309 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps.Roosevelt, Theodore (1910) African Game Trails: An Account of the African Wanderings of an American Hunter, Naturalist, New York, C. Scribner's sons Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, where they have been known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12 month period in Mozambique along a 20\u00a0km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.Although attacks against living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the tradition of the Maasai and the Hadza,Marlowe, Frank (2010), The Hadza: hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-25342-6 corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore it is not uncommon for bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coupKapu\u015bci\u0144ski, Ryszard, The Emperor: Downfall of an Autocrat. 1978.

(1994) Africa's wars and prospects for peace, M.E. Sharpe, p. 6, ISBN 1-56324-300-8 Urban hyenas In some parts of Africa, spotted hyenas have begun to frequent metropolitan areas, where groups or \"clans\" of the animals have become a menace. The Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa is estimated to have up to a thousand resident hyenas which survive by scavenging rubbish tips and predating feral dogs and cats. There have also been attacks on humans living rough. In 2013 a baby boy was killed by hyenas after being snatched from his mother as she camped near the Hilton Hotel. Some 40 of the animals were reportedly seen alongside a fence bordering the British Embassy compound. In December 2013 a cull was organised and marksmen killed ten hyenas which had occupied wasteland near the city centre. Hunting and use in traditional medicine The spotted hyena has been hunted for its body parts for use in traditional medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas.\"The scavenger or the scavenged?\" A. Rodr\u00edguez-Hidalgo. Journal of Taphonomy, 1(2010): 75\u201376 Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.Several authors during the Scramble for Africa attested that, despite its physical strength, the spotted hyena poses no danger to hunters when captured or cornered. It was often the case that native skinners refused to even touch hyena carcasses, though this was not usually a problem, as hyena skins were not considered attractive.Tjader, Richard (1910) The big game of Africa: with many illustrations from photographs by the author, D. Appleton and company in New York and, London In Burkina Faso, the hyena's tail is used for medicinal and magical purposes. In Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Senegal, the animals' whole body is harvested for bushmeat and medicine. In Malawi and Tanzania, the genitalia, nose tips and tails are used for traditional medicine. In Mozambique, traditional healers use various spotted hyena body parts, particularly the paws. Oromo hunters typically go through ritual purification after killing hyenas. Kujamaat hunters traditionally treat the spotted hyenas they kill with the same respect due to deceased tribal elders, in order to avoid retribution from hyena spirits acting on behalf of the dead animal. During the early years of Dutch colonisation in southern Africa, hyenas (referred to as \"wolves\" by the colonists) were especially susceptible to trapping, as their prediliction for carrion and lack of caution about enclosed spaces worked against them. A feature of many frontier farms was the wolwehok (hyena trap), which was roughly constructed from stone or wood and baited with meat. The trap featured a trap-door, which was designed to shut once the bait was disturbed.Beinart, William (2008) The Rise of Conservation in South Africa: Settlers, Livestock, and the Environment 1770\u20131950, Oxford University Press US, ISBN 0-19-954122-1 In the Cape Colony, spotted hyenas were often hunted by tracking them to their dens and shooting them as they escaped. Another hunting method was to trap them in their dens and dazzle them with torchlight, before stabbing them in the heart with a long knife.Moodie, John Wedderburn Dunbar (1835) Ten Years in South Africa, Vol. 1, Richard Bentley When chased by hunting dogs, spotted hyenas often turn on their attackers, unless the dogs are of exceptionally large, powerful breeds. James Stevenson-Hamilton wrote that wounded spotted hyenas could be dangerous adversaries for hunting dogs, recording an incident in which a hyena managed to kill a dog with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin. Further difficulties in killing spotted hyenas with dogs include the species' thick skin, which prevents dogs from inflicting serious damage to the animal's muscles.Daniell, Samuele; Barrow, Sir John; Somerville, William (1820), Sketches representing the native tribes, animals, and scenery of southern Africa: from drawings made by the late Mr. Samuel Daniell, W. Daniell, p. 22 Spotted hyenas in captivity and as pets From a husbandry point of view, hyenas are easily kept, as they have few disease problems and it is not uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15\u201320 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.During the 19th century, the species was frequently displayed in travelling circuses as oddities. Alfred Brehm wrote that the spotted hyena is harder to tame than the striped hyena, and that performing specimens in circuses were not up to standard. Sir John Barrow described how spotted hyenas in Sneeuberge were trained to hunt game, writing that they were \"as faithful and diligent as any of the common domestic dogs\".Barrow, Sir John (1801) An Account of Travels Into the Interior of Southern Africa, T. Cadell, jun. and W. Davies In Tanzania, spotted hyena cubs may be taken from a communal den by witchdoctors, in order to increase their social status. An April 2004 BBC article described how a shepherd living in the small town of Qabri Bayah about 50 kilometres from Jigjiga, Ethiopia managed to use a male spotted hyena as a livestock guardian dog, suppressing its urge to leave and find a mate by feeding it special herbs.Adow, Mohammed. (2004-04-12) Africa | Taming Ethiopia's hyenas. BBC News. Retrieved on 2011-02-15. If not raised with adult members of their kind, captive spotted hyenas will exhibit scent marking behaviours much later in life than wild specimens. Although easily tamed, spotted hyenas are exceedingly difficult to house train, and can be very destructive; a captive, otherwise perfectly tame, specimen in the Tower of London managed to tear an 8 ft long plank nailed to its recently repaired enclosure floor with no apparent effort.Bingley, William (1829), Animal biography, or, Popular zoology During the research leading to the composition of his monograph The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior, Hans Kruuk kept a tame hyena he named Solomon.op. cit in Kruuk (1972) Kruuk found Solomon's company so congenial, he would have kept him, but Solomon had an insatiable taste for \"cheese in the bar of the tourist lounge and bacon off the Chief Park Warden's breakfast table,\" and no door could hold him back, so Solomon was obliged to live out his days in the Edinburgh Zoo.Kruuk, Hans (1975) Hyaena. Oxford University Press, London"}, {"description": "The spotted hyena's distribution once ranged in Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the Urals, where it remained for at least one million years. Remains have also been found in the Russian Far East, and it has been theorised that the presence of hyenas there may have delayed the colonisation of North America.Summerill, Lynette; Gnawed Bones tell Tales, Summer 2003, ASU Research The causes of the species' extinction in Eurasia are still largely unknown.Varela, S., Lobo, J., Rodr\u00edguez, J., & Batra, P. (2010). Were the Late Pleistocene climatic changes responsible for the disappearance of the European spotted hyena populations? Hindcasting a species geographic distribution across time Quaternary Science Reviews, 29 (17\u201318), 2027\u20132035 In Western Europe at least, the spotted hyena's extinction coincided with a decline in grasslands 12,500 years ago. Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans which were as much at home in forests as in open lands, and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 14\u201311,000 years ago, and earlier in some areas.C. Stiner, Mary (2004) Comparative ecology and taphonomy of spotted hyenas, humans, and wolves in Pleistocene Italy, Revue de Pal\u00e9obiologie, Gen\u00e8veHistorically, the spotted hyena was widespread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It is present in all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests and the top of alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa.The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It is scarce or absent in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, it occurs in riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km\u00b2.

The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting a firm grip on it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being 300 \u2013 long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45\u20130.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.Dockner, M. (2006). Comparison of Crocuta crocuta crocuta and Crocuta crocuta spelaea through computer tomography. (Masters Thesis).The skull of the spotted hyena differs from that of the striped hyena by its much greater size and narrower sagittal crest. For its size, the spotted hyena has one of the most powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third premolars are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80\u00a0kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in\u00b2), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate.Hunter, Luke & Hinde, Gerald (2005) Cats of Africa, Struik, ISBN 1-77007-063-X The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the brown bear in bonecrushing ability,Savage, R.

(2008), Of arcs and vaults: the biomechanics of bone-cracking in spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 95, 246\u2013255. A 63.1\u00a0kg (138.8\u00a0lb) spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocone.Christiansen and Stephen Wroe, Bite Forces and Evolutionary Adaptations to Feeding Ecology in Carnivores, Ecology, Vol. 88, No. 2 DimensionsThe spotted hyena is the largest extant member of the Hyaenidae. Adults measure 95 - in body length, and have a shoulder height of 70 -. Adult male spotted hyenas in the Serengeti weigh 40.5\u201455.0\u00a0kg (89\u2014121\u00a0lb), while females weigh 44.5\u201463.9\u00a0kg (98\u2014141\u00a0lb). Spotted hyenas in Zambia tend to be heavier, with males weighing on average 67.6\u00a0kg (149\u00a0lb), and females 69.2\u00a0kg (153\u00a0lb). Exceptionally large weights of 81.7\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) and 90\u00a0kg (200\u00a0lb) are known. It has been estimated that adult members of the now extinct Eurasian populations weighed 102\u00a0kg (225\u00a0lbs).Meloro, Carlo (2007), Plio-Pleistocene large carnivores from the Italian peninsula: functional morphology and macroecology Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\" Dottorato di Ricerca in Scienze della Terra Geologia del Sedimentario \"XX Ciclo\" FurFur colour varies greatly and changes with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, that of the spotted hyena consists of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed on the back and hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly 20 mm in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present on the back of the neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring 15 \u2013) and long, stout bristle hairs (30 \u2013). European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts. Female genitalia Although the genitalia of the male spotted hyena is typical by mammalian standards, that of the female closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth.Szykman. M., Van Horn, R. C., Engh, A.L. Boydston, E. E. & Holekamp, K. E. (2007) Courtship and mating in free-living spotted hyenas. Behaviour. 144: 815\u2013846. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans.Glickman SE, Cunha GR, Drea CM, Conley AJ and Place NJ. (2006). Mammalian sexual differentiation: lessons from the spotted hyena. Trends Endocrinol Metab 17:349\u2013356. In both males and females, the base of the glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips."}, {"description": "The spotted hyena's scientific name Crocuta, was once widely thought to be derived from the Latin loanword crocutus, which translates as \"saffron-coloured one\", in reference to the animal's fur colour. This was proven to be incorrect, as the correct spelling of the loanword would have been Croc\u0101ta, and the word was never used in that sense by Graeco-Roman sources. Crocuta actually comes from the Greek word \u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (Krokottas), which is derived from the Sanskrit ko\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e2raka, which in turn originates from krosh\u1e6duka (both of which were originally meant to signify the golden jackal). The earliest recorded mention of \u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 is from Strabo's Geographica, where the animal is described as a mix of wolf and dog native to Ethiopia. From antiquity till the Renaissance, the spotted and striped hyena were either assumed to be the same species, or distinguished purely on geographical, rather than physical grounds. Hiob Ludolf, in his Historia aethiopica, was the first to clearly distinguish the Crocuta from Hyaena on account of physical, as well as geographical grounds, though he never had any first hand experience of the species, having gotten his accounts from an Ethiopian intermediary. Confusion still persisted over the exact taxonomic nature of the hyena family in general, with most European travelers in Ethiopia referring to hyenas as \"wolves\". This partly stems from the Amharic word for hyena, \u1305\u1265 (djibb), which derives from the Arabic word \u0630\u0626\u0628 (dhi'b), meaning \"wolf\".Wade, D. W. 2006. \"Hyenas and Humans in the Horn of Africa\". The Geographical Review, Vol. 96, No.4, pp. 609\u2013632.The first detailed first-hand descriptions of the spotted hyena by Europeans come from Willem Bosman and Peter Kolben. Bosman, a Dutch tradesman who worked for the Dutch West India Company at the Gold Coast (modern day Ghana) from 1688\u20131701, wrote of \"Jakhals, of Boshond\" (jackals or woodland dogs) whose physical descriptions match the spotted hyena. Kolben, a German mathematician and astronomer who worked for the Dutch East India Company in the Cape of Good Hope from 1705\u20131713, described the spotted hyena in great detail, but referred to it as a \"Tigerwolf\", because the settlers in southern Africa did not know of hyenas, and thus labelled them as \"wolves\".Bosman and Kolben's descriptions went largely unnoticed until 1771, when the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, as well as his personal experience with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828. Local and indigenous namesSeveral languages of Africa lack species specific names for hyenas: for example, the spotted and striped species have identical names in Dioula, Swahili, Malink\u00e9, M\u00f2or\u00e9, Ngambaye, Oulof and Fula. In other languages, other species may simply be termed \"small spotted hyena\", such as in Swahili, where the spotted hyena is termed fisi and the aardwolf fisi ndogo.

Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted hyena is a predator not a scavenger. This has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, and he showed through a 7 year study of hyena populations in Africa that Spotted Hyenas hunt as much as Lions, and with later studies this has been shown to be the average in all areas of Africa.Tyrants of the Cenozoic: Evolution of Bone-Crushing Hyenas and Dogs - YouTube However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.The spotted hyena is very efficient at eating its prey; not only is it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, and are more likely to stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.Wildebeest are the most commonly taken medium sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked due to differences in habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.Spotted hyenas have also been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, pangolins and pythons. There is at least one record of four hyenas killing an adult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.A single spotted hyena can eat at least 14.5\u00a0kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively toward each other when feeding, they compete with each other mostly through speed of eating, rather than by fighting as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking. Enemies and competitorsIn areas where spotted hyenas and lions are sympatric, the two species occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can be as high as 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it's the other way around.Carroll, Chris. Behind the snarl lies a cagey opportunist, proficient hunter, and dutiful parent.. National Geographic Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30\u2013100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1.AfricaHunting.com - Hyena: Scavenger or Predator? The Human Influence on Hyena & Lion The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.Although cheetahs and leopards preferentially prey on smaller animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills when the opportunity presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; there is at least one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of 2 spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.http://africageographic.com/blog/hyenas-kill-a-leopard/Spotted hyenas will follow packs of African wild dogs in order to appropriate their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off with a piece of meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, the relationship between the two species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.Creel, Scott; Creel, Nancy Marusha (2002), The African wild dog: behavior, ecology, and conservation, Princeton University Press, pp. 253\u2013254, ISBN 0-691-01654-2Spotted hyenas dominate other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, where the brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter each other on carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually has the effect of seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.Spotted Hyaena versus Brown Hyaena, Skirmishes in the Desert from Martin Harvey and M. G. L. Mills' African Predators, Smithsonian Books (Oct 2001)Jackals will feed alongside hyenas, though they will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating jackal flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden jackal. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when there is no food or young at stake.Spotted hyenas usually keep a safe distance from Nile crocodiles. Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, hyenas will avoid crocodile infested waters."}, {"description": "Spotted hyenas may contract brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They are vulnerable to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993\u20131994, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were more closely related to each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores ; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles."}, {"description": "Body language Spotted hyenas have a complex set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often combined with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females. Vocalisations The spotted hyena has an extensive vocal range, with sounds ranging from whoops, fast whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, soft grunt-laughs, loud grunt-laughs, whines and soft squeals. The loud \"who-oop\" call, along with the maniacal laughter, are among the most recognisable sounds of Africa. Typically, very high-pitched calls indicate fear or submission, while loud, lower-pitched calls express aggression. The pitch of the laugh indicates the hyena's age, while variations in the frequency of notes used when hyenas make noises convey information about the animal's social rank.Walker, Matt Hyena laughs and giggles decoded, Earth News, 01:55 GMT, Tuesday, 30 March 2010 02:55 UKDr. Hans Kruuk compiled the following table on spotted hyena calls in 1972; Name Sound description Posture Context Whoop A series of 6\u20139 (sometimes 15) calls lasting 2\u20133 seconds each and spaced 2\u201310 seconds apart. The general tone is a \"oo\" tone which begins in a low pitch and ends with a high note. This sound can be heard more than 5\u00a0km away. Usually done standing, with the mouth opened slightly and the head bent down Used by both sexes when alone or in a group, and appears to be done spontaneously without external cause Fast whoop Similar to the whoop, but higher pitched and with shorter intervals Tail is either horizontal or high with the ears cocked. Often done while running, with the mouth bent down Used with other hyenas present just before the onset of an attack, often during a dispute over a kill with lions or other hyenas Grunt A soft, very low pitched growling sound which lasts several seconds The mouth is closed, and the posture aggressive Emitted on the approach of another, unwelcome hyena, and may be followed by chasing Groan Similar to above, but more \"ooo\" sounding and higher in pitch Before and during meeting ceremonies Low \"Ooo\" sound with a usually low pitch and lasts several seconds The mouth is slightly open with the head horizontal Like the fast whoop, but with less tendency to attack Giggle A series of loud, very high pitched \"hee-hee-hee\" sounds usually lasting less than 5 seconds. Running in a fleeing posture with the mouth slightly open When attacked or chased, usually over a kill Yell A loud, high pitched call lasting several seconds As with the giggle As with the giggle, but when actually being bitten Growl A loud, rattling, low pitched sound lasting several seconds, with an \"aa\" and \"oh\" quality Defensive posture When under attack, preceding a retaliatory bite Soft grunt-laugh A rapid succession of low pitched, soft sounding staccato grunts lasting several seconds The mouth is closed or slightly open with a fleeing posture and the tail horizontal or high and the ears cocked When fleeing in surprise from a lion, man or when attacking large prey Loud grunt-laugh Louder than the soft grunt-laugh, though still not very loud, and often lasts more than 5 minutes The mouth is the same as in the soft grunt-laugh, but with the tail high and ears cocked In encounters with lions or other hyena clans Whine Loud, high pitched, rapid, drawn out \"eeee\" sounding squeals The mouth is slightly open with the head and tail hanging low Mostly used by cubs when following a female before suckling, or when thwarted from getting food Soft squeal Same as above, but softer and without the staccato quality The mouth is slightly open with the ears flattened and the head tilted to one side with the teeth bared Used by both cubs and adults encountering a clan-mate after a long separation"}, {"description": "Social behaviourSpotted hyenas are social animals which live in large communities (referred to as \"clans\") which can consist of at most 80 individuals. Group-size varies geographically; in the Serengeti, where prey is migratory, clans are smaller than those in the Ngorongoro Crater, where prey is sedentary. Spotted hyena clans are more compact and unified than wolf packs, but are not as closely knit as those of African wild dogs. Females dominate males, with even the lowest ranking females being dominant over the highest ranking males. It is typical for females to remain with their natal clan, thus large clans usually contain several matrilines, whereas males typically disperse from their natal clan at the age of 2\u00bd years. The clan is a fission-fusion society, in which clan-members do not often remain together, but may forage alone or in small groups. High-ranking hyenas maintain their position through aggression directed against lower-ranking clan-members. Spotted hyena hierarchy is nepotistic; the offspring of dominant females automatically outrank adult females subordinate to their mother. However, rank in spotted hyena cubs is greatly dependent on the presence of the mother; low-ranking adults may act aggressively toward higher-ranking cubs when the mother is absent. Although individual spotted hyenas only care for their own young, and males take no part in raising their young, cubs are able to identify relatives as distantly related as great-aunts. Also, males associate more closely with their own daughters rather than unrelated cubs, and the latter favour their fathers by acting less aggressively toward them.Spotted hyena societies are more complex than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably similar to those of cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise 3rd party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena societies are not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks.Drea CM, Frank LG (2003) The social complexity of spotted hyenas. In: Animal Social Complexity: Intelligence, Culture, and Individualized Societies (eds de Waal FBM, Tyack PL). pp. 121\u2013148, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Holekamp KE, Sakai ST, Lundrigan BL (2007) Social intelligence in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, London B, 362, 523\u2013538. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare.Territory size is highly variable, ranging from less than 40\u00a0km\u00b2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000\u00a0km\u00b2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and boundary patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males are more likely to enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after a long period of time if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills. Mating, reproduction, and development The spotted hyena is a non-seasonal breeder, though a birth peak does occur during the wet season. Females are polyestrus, with an estrus period lasting two weeks. Like many felid species, the spotted hyena is promiscuous, and no enduring pair bonds are formed. Members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over the course of several years. Males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat, even if the male outweighs his partner. Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born. Older females show a similar preference, with the addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships.How Hyenas Avoid Incest by LiveScience Staff, posted: 15 August 2007 01:00 pm ET. Passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones.It\u2019s a dog\u2019s life \u2013 aggressive male hyenas fail to impress the girls from innovations report, May 14, 2003. Copulation in spotted hyenas is a relatively short affair, lasting 4\u201312 minutes, and typically only occurs at night with no other hyenas present. The mating process is complicated, as the male's penis enters and exits the female's reproductive tract through her pseudo-penis rather than directly through the vagina, which is blocked by the false scrotum and testes. These unusual traits make mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, while also ensuring that rape is physically impossible. Once the female retracts her clitoris, the male enters the female by sliding beneath her, an operation facilitated by the penis's upward angle. Once this is accomplished, a typical mammalian mating posture is adopted. The length of the gestation period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is the average length of time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels \u2013 the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione \u2013 are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology.Nelson RJ. 2005. Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. p. 115. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males.The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex, by Bjorn Carey, LiveScience Staff Writer, posted: 26 April 2006 01:00 pm ET. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.Cubs are born with soft, brownish black hair, and weigh 1.5\u00a0kg on average. Unique among carnivorous mammals, spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6\u20137\u00a0mm long canine teeth and 4\u00a0mm long incisors. Also, cubs will attack each other shortly after birth. This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters, and can result in the death of the weaker cub. This neonatal siblicide kills an estimated 25% of all hyenas in their first month. Male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance, while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan. Lactating females can carry 3\u20134\u00a0kg (6.5\u20139\u00a0lb) of milk in their udders. Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore, and its fat content is second only to that of the polar bear and sea otter. Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12\u201316 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months. Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young. Females are very protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them. Spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours very early in life; cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before the age of one month. Within ten days of birth, they are able to move at considerable speed. Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2\u20133 months. They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months, and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year. Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years. The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years, with a maximum of 25 years. Denning behaviour The clan's social life revolves around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens within a year or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an entrance width of \u00bd\u20131 metre (1.6\u20137.7\u00a0ft) to as small as 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in). In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large bare patches around their entrances, where hyenas move or lie down on. Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited 20 metres (65.6\u00a0ft) away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and it is not uncommon to see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den. IntelligenceCompared to other hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater relative amount of frontal cortex which is involved in the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them.Hyenas Surprisingly Good at Cooperative Tasks By LiveScience Staff, posted: 28 September 2009 12:56 pm ET The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas. Hunting behaviourUnlike other large African carnivores, spotted hyenas do not preferentially prey on any species, and only buffalo and giraffe are significantly avoided. Spotted hyenas prefer prey with a body mass range of 56\u2013182\u00a0kg (123.5\u2013401\u00a0lb), with a mode of 102\u00a0kg (224.9\u00a0lb).Hayward, M. W., Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), Journal of Zoology 270 (2006) 606\u2013614 When hunting medium to large sized prey, spotted hyenas tend to select certain categories of animal; young animals are frequently targeted, as are old ones, though the latter category is not so significant when hunting zebras, due to their aggressive antipredator behaviours. The spotted hyena tracks live prey by sight, hearing and smell. Carrion is detected by smell and the sound of other predators feeding. During daylight hours, it watches vultures descending upon carcasses. Its auditory perception is powerful enough for it to detect sounds of predators killing prey or feeding on carcasses over distances of up to 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi). Unlike the grey wolf, the spotted hyena relies more on sight than smell when hunting, and does not follow its prey's prints or travel in single file. Small prey is killed by being shaken in the mouth, while large prey is eaten alive.Spotted hyenas usually hunt wildebeest either singly, or in groups of two or three. They catch adult wildebeest usually after 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) chases at speeds of up to 60\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mi/h). Chases are usually initiated by one hyena and, with the exception of cows with calves, there is little active defense from the wildebeest herd. Wildebeest will sometimes attempt to escape hyenas by taking to water although, in such cases, the hyenas almost invariably catch them. Zebras require different hunting methods to those used for wildebeest, due to their habit of running in tight groups and aggressive defence from stallions. Typical zebra hunting groups consist of 10\u201325 hyenas, though there is one record of a hyena killing an adult zebra unaided.Brockmann, H. Jane; Snowdon, Charles T.; Macedo, Regina (2010) Behavioral Ecology of Tropical Animals: Volume 42 of Advances in the Study of Behavior, Academic Press, p. 206, ISBN 0-12-380894-4 During a chase, zebras typically move in tight bunches, with the hyenas pursuing behind in a crescent formation. Chases are usually relatively slow, with an average speed of 15\u201330\u00a0km/h. A stallion will attempt to place himself between the hyenas and the herd, though once a zebra falls behind the protective formation it is immediately set upon, usually after a chase of 3\u00a0km (1.8\u00a0mi). Though hyenas may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd and attempt to dodge the stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas. When hunting Thomson's gazelles, spotted hyenas usually operate alone, and prey primarily on young fawns. Chases against both adult and young gazelles can cover distances of 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) with speeds of 60\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mi/h). Female gazelles do not defend their fawns, though they may attempt to distract hyenas by feigning weakness."}, {"description": "The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), also known as the laughing hyena, is a species of hyena, currently classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is however experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.The spotted hyena is the most social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social organisation is unlike that of any other carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.The spotted hyena is a highly successful animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success is due in part to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2\u20135 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60\u00a0km/h.The spotted hyena has a long history of interaction with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild."}]}

One of the apes was recovered and sent to the Berlin Zoological Museum, where Professor Paul Matschie (1861\u20131926) classified the animal as a new form of gorilla and named it Gorilla beringei after the man who discovered it. In 1925 Carl Akeley, a hunter from the American Museum of Natural History who wished to study the gorillas, convinced Albert I of Belgium to establish the Albert National Park to protect the animals of the Virunga mountains.George Schaller began his 20 month observation of the mountain gorillas in 1959, subsequently publishing two books: The Mountain Gorilla and The Year of the Gorilla. Little was known about the life of the mountain gorilla before his research, which described its social organization, life history, and ecology. Following Schaller, Dian Fossey began what would become an 18 year study in 1967. Fossey made new observations, completed the first accurate census, and established active conservation practices, such as anti-poaching patrols. The Digit Fund, which Dian Fossey started, continued her work and was later renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fund's Karisoke Research Center monitors and protects the mountain gorillas of the Virungas. Close monitoring and research of the Bwindi mountain gorillas began in the 1990s.Robbins MM, Gray M, Kagoda E, Robbins AM 2009, Population dynamics of the Bwindi mountain gorillas, Biological Conservation 142(12): 2886-2895"}, {"description": "The fur of the mountain gorilla, often thicker and longer than that of other gorilla species, enables them to live in colder temperatures. Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to each individual. Males, at a mean weight of 195 kg and upright standing height of 150 cm usually weigh twice as much as the females, at a mean of 100 kg and a height of 130 cm. This subspecies is on average the second largest species of primate; only the Eastern Lowland Gorilla, the other subspecies of Eastern Gorilla, is larger. Adult males have more pronounced bony crests on the top and back of their skulls, giving their heads a more conical shape. These crests anchor the powerful temporalis muscles, which attach to the lower jaw (mandible). Adult females also have these crests, but they are less pronounced. Like all gorillas they feature dark brown eyes framed by a black ring around the iris.Adult males are called silverbacks because a saddle of gray or silver-colored hair develops on their backs with age. The hair on their backs is shorter than on most other body parts, and their arm hair is especially long. Fully erect, males reach 1.9 m in height, with an arm span of 2.3 m and weigh 220 kg. The tallest silverback recorded was a 1.94 m individual shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. There's an unconfirmed record of another individual, shot in 1932, that was 2.06 m (6\u00a0ft 9 in) tall. The heaviest was a 1.83 m silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon which weighed about 266 kg.The mountain gorilla is primarily terrestrial and quadrupedal. However, it will climb into fruiting trees if the branches can carry its weight, and it is capable of running bipedally up to 6 m. Like all great apes other than humans, its arms are longer than its legs. It moves by knuckle-walking (like the common chimpanzee, but unlike the bonobo and both orangutan species), supporting its weight on the backs of its curved fingers rather than its palms.The mountain gorilla is diurnal, most active between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Many of these hours are spent eating, as large quantities of food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests."}, {"description": "Mountain gorillas are descendants of ancestral monkeys and apes found in Africa and Arabia during the start of the Oligocene epoch (34-24 million years ago). The fossil record provides evidence of the hominoid primates (apes) found in east Africa about 18\u201322 million years ago. The fossil record of the area where mountain gorillas live is particularly poor and so its evolutionary history is not clear. It was about 9 million years ago that the group of primates that were to evolve into gorillas split from their common ancestor with humans and chimps; this is when the genus Gorilla emerged. It is not certain what this early relative of the gorilla was, but it is traced back to the early ape Proconsul africanus. Mountain gorillas have been isolated from eastern lowland gorillas for about 400,000 years and these two taxa separated from their western counterparts approximately 2 million years ago. There has been considerable and as yet unresolved debate over the classification of mountain gorillas. The genus was first referenced as Troglodytes in 1847, but renamed to Gorilla in 1852. It was not until 1967 that the taxonomist Colin Groves proposed that all gorillas be regarded as one species (Gorilla gorilla) with three sub-species Gorilla gorilla gorilla (western lowland gorilla), Gorilla gorilla graueri (lowland gorillas found west of the Virungas) and Gorilla gorilla beringei (mountain gorillas including, Gorilla beringei found in the Virungas and Bwindi). In 2003 after a review they were divided into two species (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) by The World Conservation Union (IUCN)."}, {"description": "Population size and growth ratesConservation efforts have led to an increase in overall population of the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virungas and at Bwindi. The overall population is now believed to be at least 880 individuals. Three more \u2013 infants who suffered a traumatic poaching experience, injuries from snares, and/or losing their mothers in brutal killings \u2013 are currently in care of the Senkwekwe Centre orphanage in the DR of Congo.In December 2010 the official website of Virunga National Park announced that \"the number of mountain gorillas living in the tri-national forested area of which Virunga forms a part, has increased by 26.3% over the last seven years - an average growth rate of 3.7% per annum.\" The 2010 census estimated that 480 mountain gorillas inhabited the region. The 2003 census had estimated the Virunga gorilla population to be 380 individuals; which represented a 17% increase in the total population since 1989 when there were 320 individualsGray, M, McNeilage, A, Fawcett, K, Robbins, MM, Ssebide, B, Mbula, D, Uwingeli, P.2006. Virunga Volcano Range mountain gorilla census, 2003. Joint organisers\u2019 report, UWA/ORTPN/ICCN. The population has almost doubled since its nadir in 1981, when a census estimated that only 254 gorillas remained.Aveling, C., Harcourt, A.H., 1984. A census of the Virunga gorillas. Oryx 18, 8-13.The 2006 census at Bwindi indicated a population of 340 gorillas, representing a 6% increase in total population size since 2002 and a 12% increase from 320 individuals in 1997.McNeilage, A, Robbins, MM, Gray, M, Olupot, W, Babaasa, D, Bitariho, R, Kasangaki, A, Rainer, H, Asuma, S, Mugiri, G, Baker, J. 2006. Census of the mountain gorilla population in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Oryx 40: 419-427 All of those estimates were based on traditional census methods using dung samples collected at night nests. Conversely, genetic analyses of the entire population during the 2006 census indicated there were only approximately 300 individuals in Bwindi. The discrepancy highlights the difficulty in using imprecise census data to estimate population growth.In both Bwindi and the Virungas, groups of gorillas that were habituated for research and ecotourism have higher growth rates than unhabituated gorillas, according to computer modeling of their population dynamics. Habituation means that through repeated, neutral contact with humans, gorillas exhibit normal behavior when people are in proximity. Habituated gorillas are more closely guarded by field staff and they receive veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. Nonetheless, researchers recommended that some gorillas remain unhabituated as a bet-hedging strategy against the risk of human pathogens being transmitted throughout the population.Despite their recent population growth, the mountain gorilla remains threatened. As of 2008, mountain gorillas were listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and are dependent on conservation efforts to survive. Threat Effect on Gorilla Population Conservation Efforts Poaching Gorillas are maimed or killed by traps set for other animals. Abduction of infants for illegal selling to zoos and as pets. This often results in other adult gorillas being killed in the process. Increased patrolling using armed guards in protected forest areas. Karisoke\u2019s guards find and remove some 1,000 snares each year. Gorilla censuses to monitor gorilla population. Karisoke Research Centre runs a facility for young gorillas rescued from poachers. Habitat loss Rapidly expanding human settlements are removing the gorilla habitat. Fragmentation of forested areas has resulted in the isolation of gorilla groups from each other, reducing genetic diversity. Expansion of areas of national park to protect habitat. Disease Regular contact of tourists with the gorillas allows transmission of diseases from humans to the gorillas. Domestic animals and livestock also contribute to disease transmission. Requirement to stay at least 7 meters from gorillas at all times. Better management of ecotourism. More education for local communities to minimise impact of livestock. War and unrest Refugees removing trees to create settlements and farms. Increased use of gorillas for meat by displaced peoples. Gorillas can be killed by land mines placed along forest paths. Local communities Habitat removal. Lack of support for conservation efforts due to insufficient education and awareness amongst locals. Poverty encourages the use of slash and burn agriculture to grow food. Karisoke Research centre has: Created Virunga biodiversity inventory and field guides, to support public education and ecotourism. Supplied primary school students with books and other materials. Run conservation programs for secondary schools. Provided biodiversity training for local park staff and conservation groups. Provide field courses and internships for Rwandan college students. Poaching: Mountain gorillas are not usually hunted for bushmeat, but they are frequently maimed or killed by traps and snares intended for other animals. They have been killed for their heads, hands, and feet, which are sold to collectors. Infants are sold to zoos, researchers, and people who want them as pets. The abduction of infants generally involves the loss of at least one adult, as members of a group will fight to the death to protect their young. The Virunga gorillas are particularly susceptible to animal trafficking for the illegal pet trade. With young gorillas worth from $1000 to $5000 on the black market, poachers seeking infant and juvenile specimens will kill and wound other members of the group in the process.Stoinski T.S., Steklis H.D., and Mehlman P.T. (2008) Conservation in the 21st Century: Gorillas as a Case Study. Developments in Primatology: Progress and Prospects. XVI, 368 p. 41 illus., 2 in colour. Those of the group that survive often disband. One well documented case was that known as the \u2018Taiping 4\u2019. In this situation, a Malaysian Zoo received four wild-born infant gorillas from Nigeria at a cost of US$1.6 million using falsified export documents.IPPL News (2002a). Animal dealer offers gorilla babies. IPPL News 29(1):3\u20134.IPPL News (2002b). \u201cTaiping Four\u201d Gorillas to be confiscated. IPPL News 29(3):9\u201310. Poaching for meat is also particularly threatening in regions of political unrest. Most of the African great apes survive in areas of chronic insecurity, where there is a breakdown of law and order. The killing of mountain gorillas at Bikenge in Virunga National Park in January 2007 was a well documented case.Habitat loss: This is one of the most severe threats to gorilla populations. The forests where mountain gorillas live are surrounded by rapidly increasing human settlement. Through shifting (slash-and-burn) agriculture, pastoral expansion and logging, villages in forest zones cause fragmentation and degradation of habitat.Draulans, D., and Van Krunkoisven 2001, The impact of war on forest areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Oryx 36(1):35\u201340. The late 1960s saw the Virunga Conservation Area (VCA) of Rwanda\u2019s national park reduced by more than half of its original size to support the cultivation of Pyrethrum. This led to a massive reduction in mountain gorilla population numbers by the mid-1970s.Weber, A.W., and Vedder, A. 1983, Population dynamics of the Virunga gorillas: 1959\u20131978. Biological Conservation 26(4):341\u2013366. The resulting deforestation confines the gorillas to isolated deserts. Some groups may raid crops for food, creating further animosity and retaliation. The impact of habitat loss extends beyond the reduction of suitable living space for gorillas. As gorilla groups are increasingly geographically isolated from one another due to human settlements, the genetic diversity of each group is reduced. Some signs of inbreeding are already appearing in younger gorillas, including webbed hands and feet.Disease: Despite the protection garnered from being located in national parks, the mountain gorilla is also at risk from people of a more well-meaning nature. Groups subjected to regular visits from tourists and locals are at a continued risk of disease cross-transmission (Lilly et al., 2002) \u2013 this is in spite of attempts to enforce a rule that humans and gorillas be separated by a distance of 7 metres at all times to prevent this. With a similar genetic makeup to humans and an immune system that has not evolved to cope with human disease, this poses a serious conservation threat.Lilly, A.A., Mehlamn, P.T., and Doran, D. (2002). Intestinal parasites in gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans at Mondika Research site, Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic. International Journal of Primatology 23(3):555\u2013573. Indeed, according to some researchers, infectious diseases (predominantly respiratory) are responsible for about 20% of sudden deaths in mountain gorilla populations. With the implementation of a successful ecotourism program in which human-gorilla interaction was minimised, during the period of 1989\u20132000 four sub-populations in Rwanda experienced an increase of 76%. By contrast, seven of the commonly visited sub-populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) saw a decline of almost 20% over only four years (1996\u20132000).Kalpers, J., Williamson, E.A., Robbins, M.M., McNeilage, A., Nzamurambaho, A.,Lola, N., and Mugiri, G. (2003). Gorillas in the crossfire: Population dynamics of the Virunga mountain gorillas over the past three decades. Oryx 37:326\u2013337. From this, we can conclude that the negative impacts of ecotourism on gorilla health can be minimised if proper management is undertaken.The risk of disease transmission is not limited to those of a human origin; pathogens from domestic animals and livestock through contaminated water are also a concern.Graczyk, T.K., Bosco-Nizeyi, J., Ssebide, B., Thompson, A., Read,C., and Cranfield, M.R. (2002). Anthropozoonotic Giardia duodenalis genotype (assemblage) A infections in habitats of free-ranging human-habituated gorillas, Uganda. J. Parasit. 88:905\u2013909. Studies have found that water borne, gastrointestinal parasites such as Cryptosporidium sp., Microsporidia sp.,and Giardia sp. are genetically identical when found in livestock, humans, and gorillas; particularly along theborder of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda.Nizeyi, J.B., Cranfield, M.R., and Graczyk, T.K.

Cryptosporidiosis in people sharing habitats with free ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei), Uganda. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 66(4):442\u2013444. Another example of human induced disease is Tuberculosis; Kabagambe et al. found that as high as 11% of cattle in Rwanda suffered from this affliction.War and civil unrest: Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have been politically unstable and beleaguered by war and civil unrest over the last decades. Simulation modeling, Byers et al. (2003) has suggested that times of war and unrest have negative impacts on the habitat and populations of mountain gorillas.Byers A.P., Miller P.S., and Westley F.R. 2003, Guns, Germs and Refugees: The Mountain Gorilla PHVA in Uganda. In: Westley, F.R., and Miller, P.S. (eds.). Experiments in Consilience. Washington, DC: Island Press, pp. 105\u2013130. For example, events such as 1994\u2019s Rwanda genocide would take place approximately every 30 years, with each event lasting for 10 years. Due to the increase in human encounters, aggressive and passive alike, this would result in a rise in mortality rates and a decrease in reproductive success. More direct impacts from conflict can also be seen. Kanyamibwa notes that there were reports that mines were placed along trails in the Volcanos National Park, and that many gorillas were killed as a result.Kanyamibwa S 1998, Impact of war on conservation: Rwandan environment and wildlife in agony, Biodiversity and Conservation 7(11): 1399-1406 Pressure from habitat destruction in the form of logging also increased as refugees fled the cities and cut down trees for wood. During the Rwandan genocide, some poaching activity was also linked to the general breakdown of law and order and lack of any ramifications.Glew L & Hudson MD 2007, Gorillas in the midst: the impact of armed conflict on the conservation of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa, Oryx 41(2): 140-150 Conservation efforts The main International Non-Government Organization involved in conservation of mountain gorillas is the International Gorilla Conservation Programme, which was established in 1991 as a joint effort of the African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna & Flora International and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Conservation requires work at many levels, from local to international, and involves protection and law enforcement as well as research and education. Dian Fossey broke down conservation efforts into the following three categories: Active conservation includes frequent patrols in wildlife areas to destroy poacher equipment and weapons, firm and prompt law enforcement, census counts in regions of breeding and ranging concentration, and strong safeguards for the limited habitat the animals occupy.\"Theoretical conservation seeks to encourage growth in tourism by improving existing roads that circle the mountains, by renovating the park headquarters and tourists' lodging, and by the habituation of gorillas near the park boundaries for tourists to visit and photograph.\"Community-based conservation management involves biodiversity protection by, for, and with the local communityWestern D and Wright RM (1994) Natural Connections. Island Press, Washington, DC. in practise this is applied in varying degrees. The process seeks equity between meeting the needs of the local population and preserving the protected areas and involves local people in decision making processes.A collaborative management process has had some success in the Bwindi National Park. The forest was gazetted to National Park in 1991; this occurred with little community consultation and the new status prohibited local people from accessing resources within the park as well as reduced economic opportunities. Subsequently a number of forest fires were deliberately lit and threats were made to the gorillas.Hamilton A, Cunningham A, Byarugaba D, Kayanja F 2000 Conservation in a Region of Political Instability: Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda. Conservation Biology 14(6):1722\u20131725 To counteract this, three schemes to provide benefits from existence of the forest communities and involve the local community in park management were developed. They included agreements allowing the controlled harvesting of resources in the park, receipt of some revenue from tourism and establishment of a trust fund partly for community development. Tension between people and park have been reduced and now there is more willingness to take part in gorilla protection.Wild RG and Mutebi J 1996, Conservation through community use of plant resources: Establishing Collaborative Management in Bwindi Impenetrable and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park Uganda, People and Plants Working Paper, Division of Ecological Sciences, UNESCO Surveys of community attitudes conducted by CARE show a steadily increasing proportion of the people in favour of the park. More than that there have been no cases of deliberate burning and the problem of snares in these areas has been reduced. The introduction of ceremonies such as Kwita Izina (in 2005) has also had some impact in drawing attention to gorilla preservation and its importance to local communities.While community-based conservation bears out individual analysis, there are significant overlaps between active and theoretical conservation and a discussion of the two as halves of a whole seems more constructive. For example, in 2002 Rwanda's national parks went through a restructuring process. The director of the IGCP, Eugene Rutagarama stated that \u201cThey got more rangers on better salaries, more radios, more patrol cars and better training in wildlife conservation. They also built more shelters in the park, from which rangers could protect the gorillas\". The funding for these types of improvements usually comes from tourism - in 2008, approximately 20 000 tourists visited gorilla populations in Rwanda, generating around $8 million in revenue for the parks. In Uganda too, tourism is seen as a \u201chigh value activity that generates enough revenue to cover park management costs and contribute to the national budget of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.\"Sandbrook C and Semple S, The rules and the reality of mountain gorilla Gorilla beringei beringei tracking: how close do tourists get? Oryx Vol 40 No 4 October 2006 pp: 428-433 Furthermore, tourist visits which are conducted by park rangers also allow censuses of gorilla sub-populations to be undertaken concurrently.In addition to tourism, other measures for conservation of the sub-population can be taken such as ensuring connecting corridors between isolated areas to make movement between them easier and safer.Harcourt A and Curry-Lindahl K 1979, Conservation of the Mountain Gorilla and its Habitat in Rwanda. Environmental conservation, 6(2):143 - 147"}, {"description": "Social structureThe mountain gorilla is highly social, and lives in relatively stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between adult males and females. Relationships among females are relatively weak. These groups are nonterritorial; the silverback generally defends his group rather than his territory. In the Virunga mountain gorillas, the average length of tenure for a dominant silverback is 4.7 years. 61% of groups are composed of one adult male and a number of females and 36% contain more than one adult male. The remaining gorillas are either lone males or exclusively male groups, usually made up of one mature male and a few younger males. Group sizes vary from five to thirty, with an average of ten individuals. A typical group contains: one dominant silverback, who is the group's undisputed leader; another subordinate silverback (usually a younger brother, half-brother, or even an adult son of the dominant silverback); one or two blackbacks, who act as sentries; three to four sexually mature females, who are ordinarily bonded to the dominant silverback for life; and from three to six juveniles and infants.Most males, and about 60% of females, leave their natal group. Males leave when they are about 11 years old, and often the separation process is slow: they spend more and more time on the edge of the group until they leave altogether. They may travel alone or with an all-male group for 2\u20135 years before they can attract females to join them and form a new group. Females typically emigrate when they are about 8 years old, either transferring directly to an established group or beginning a new one with a lone male. Females often transfer to a new group several times before they settle down with a certain silverback male.The dominant silverback generally determines the movements of the group, leading it to appropriate feeding sites throughout the year. He also mediates conflicts within the group and protects it from external threats. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, the silverback will protect them even at the cost of his own life. He is the center of attention during rest sessions, and young animals frequently stay close to him and include him in their games. If a mother dies or leaves the group, the silverback is usually the one who looks after her abandoned offspring, even allowing them to sleep in his nest. This is a form of alloparental care which is a common behavior and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant and the wolf.Riedman, Marianne L. (December 1982). \u201cThe Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds\u201d. The Quarterly Review of Biology 57 (4): 405-435 Experienced silverbacks are capable of removing poachers' snares from the hands or feet of their group members.When the dominant silverback dies or is killed by disease, accident, or poachers, the family group may be severely disrupted. Unless he leaves behind a male descendant capable of taking over his position, the group will either split up or be taken over in its entirety by an unrelated male. When a new silverback takes control of a family group, he may kill all of the infants of the dead silverback. This practice of infanticide is an effective reproductive strategy, in that the newly acquired females are then able to conceive the new male's offspring. Infanticide has not been observed in stable groups. AggressionAlthough strong and powerful, gorillas are generally gentle and shy. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet, the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.For this reason, conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviors that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical. The ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps: (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3) rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running, two-legged to four-legged, (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground with palms to end display. Affiliation The midday rest period is an important time for establishing and reinforcing relationships within the group. Mutual grooming reinforces social bonds, and helps keep hair free from dirt and parasites. It is not as common among gorillas as in other primates, although females groom their offspring regularly. Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large adults. Playing helps them learn how to communicate and behave within the group. Activities include wrestling, chasing, and somersaults. The silverback and his females tolerate and even participate if encouraged. VocalizationTwenty-five distinct vocalizations are recognized, many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are the most common form of intragroup communication. FearsFor reasons unknown, mountain gorillas that have been studied appear to be naturally afraid of certain reptiles. Infants, whose natural behavior is to chase anything that moves, will go out of their way to avoid chameleons and caterpillars. They are also afraid of water and will cross streams only if they can do so without getting wet (i.e. crossing over fallen logs). Dian Fossey observed and noted the mountain gorilla's obvious dislike of rain, as well."}, {"description": "The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla.

The other is found in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists consider the Bwindi population in Uganda may be a separate subspecies, though no description has been finished.

Most are found on the slopes of three of the dormant volcanoes: Karisimbi, Mikeno, and Visoke. The vegetation is very dense at the bottom of the mountains, becoming more sparse at higher elevations, and the forests where the mountain gorilla lives are often cloudy, misty and cold.The mountain gorilla is primarily a herbivore; the majority of its diet is composed of the leaves, shoots and stems (85.8%) of 142 plant species. It also feeds on bark (6.9%), roots (3.3%), flowers (2.3%), and fruit (1.7%), as well as small invertebrates. (0.1%). Adult males can eat up to 34 kg of vegetation a day, while a female can eat as much as 18 kg.The home range size (the area used by one group of gorillas during one year) is influenced by availability of food sources and usually includes several vegetation zones. George Schaller identified ten distinct zones, including: the bamboo forests at 2200 \u2013; the Hagenia forests at 2800 \u2013; and the giant senecio zone at 3400 \u2013. The mountain gorilla spends most of its time in the Hagenia forests, where galium vines are found year-round. All parts of this vine are consumed: leaves, stems, flowers, and berries. It travels to the bamboo forests during the few months of the year fresh shoots are available, and it climbs into subalpine regions to eat the soft centers of giant senecio trees."}]}

Being monogamous, pairs of maras stay together for life with replacement of partners only occurring after its death.Genest, H. & Dubost, G. (1974) \"Pair living in the mara ( Dolichotis paragonum Z ) \" Mammalia 38: 155-162. The male has almost the sole responsibility in maintaining the pair by following the female wherever she goes. A male will mark his female with urine and mark the ground around her with secretions from his glands and with feces, making the grounds around the female a mobile territory. Pairs will breed together alone or with other pairs in warrens shared by up to 29 pairs. Maras breed, at least in southern Argentina, from August to January. Gestation lasts 100 days in wild. Most births in Patagonia occur between September and October which is before the summer dry season and after the winter rains. Female produce one litter each year in the wild, but can produce as many as four litters a year in captivity. Young can walk almost immediately postpartum. Dens are dug during the breeding season for the young to be raised. Litters from 1-22 pairs are grouped together in these dens. Communal living provides protection from predators with the survival rate for young being higher in larger groups than in smaller groups. One pair visits the den at a time for around one hour and the other parents will circle around the den.U. GANSLOSSER, S. WEHNELT (1997) \"Juvenile development as part of the extraordinary social system of the Mara Dolichotis patagonum (Rodentia: Caviidae) \", Mammalia 61:3-15. 1-2 pups are nursed at a time by a female. A female may sometimes nurse a young from another pair. While a female may prevent young other than her own from nursing her, some young are able to steal milk. Mothers do not actively cooperate in raising their young. For the first three weeks, young remain near the den. At this time there is low inter-individual distance, frequent body contact, huddling, allogrooming and extended play among the pup. After this, the young are able to leave the den and graze with their parents. Young are weaned after 13 weeks.Maras will make a number of vocalizations during grazing or slow locomotion. When seeking contact, a mara will emit an inflected wheet while a low repetitive grunt is made when following a conspecific. Mara tooth chatter and emit low grunts when threatened. They also produce a series of short grunts when grooming.Eisenberg, J. F. (1974). \"The function and motivational basis of hystricomorph vocalizations\". Symp. Zool. Soc. London 34, 211-248. Scent marking is used by maras for complex and intense social interactions. Maras will stretch and sniff the soil and then sit upright with an arched back and the anogenital area flattened to the ground, a process known as anal digging. In addition a male will stand on his hind legs and urinate on a female\u2019s rump to which the female will respond by spraying a jet of urine backwards into the face of the male. The male\u2019s urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female\u2019s urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive. Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males.TABER, B. E., AND D. W. MACDONALD.

Maras prefer sandy and low shrub habitat in Valdes Peninsula.

When running, maras have been compared to deer and antelope.Smythe. N., (1970) \"On the existence of pursuit invitation signals in mammals\". American Naturalist 104(938): 491-94.

The daily activity of the mara is unimodal in winter and biomodal in other seasons. The preferred temperature of the mara is around 20 CC. Females spend more time feeding than the males, due to the demands of gestation and lactation. Males spend most of the day sitting, being vigilant for predators.

Journal of Mammalogy, 67: 91-102. Bats travel between primary and peripheral roost trees, especially on hot days, as they may need shade. These flights are typically short but longer flights have been recorded in midday.Unlike other false vampire bats, the yellow-winged bat feeds only on insects and not small vertebrates. It will feed on both soft- and hard-bodied insects. Bats may feed on termites, scarab beetles, orthopterans, lepidopterans and dipterans. The size of prey ranges from \"very small to relatively large\". The yellow-winged bat is a sit-and-wait predator. They perch and listen for prey and if it flies by, the bat launches its attack. This species, while potentially vulnerable to predation, the bat is very alert. Mambas, bat hawks, night tree vipers and common kestrels may prey on this species."}, {"description": "Little is known about human impacts on the population of the yellow-winged bat and the population dynamics of the species have not been recorded.

A single egg is fertilized, but implantation is delayed for three to four months to ensure the young will not be born during an unfavorable time. Once the zygote does implant in the uterus, a gestation period of four months occurs, during which the zygote splits into four identical embryos, each of which develops its own placenta, so blood and nutrients are not mixed between them.

The armadillo crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico in the late 19th century, and was introduced in Florida at about the same time by humans. By 1995, the species had become well established in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and had been sighted as far afield as Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. A decade later, the armadillo had become established in all of those areas and continued its migration, being sighted as far north as southern Nebraska, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana. The primary cause of this rapid expansion is explained simply by the species having few natural predators within the United States, little desire on the part of Americans to hunt or eat the armadillo, and the animals' high reproductive rate. The northern expansion of the armadillo is expected to continue until the species reaches as far north as Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut,Waterbury Wildlife Control Info, Jan 19, 2015 and all points southward on the East Coast of the United States. Further northward and westward expansion will probably be limited by the armadillo's poor tolerance of harsh winters, due to its lack of insulating fat and its inability to hibernate. As of 2009, newspaper reports indicated the nine-banded armadillo seems to have expanded its range northward as far as Omaha, Nebraska in the west, and Kentucky Dam and Evansville, Indiana, in the east.Schroeder, Owen (October 4, 2008) Armadillos take up residence in Tenn. theleafchronicle.com In 1995, armadillos were only seen in the southern tip of South Carolina, and within two to three years, they had swept across most of the state.

Studies have shown the fan-tailed warbler habitually follows armadillos to feed on insects and other invertebrates displaced by them.They are typically hunted for their meat, which is said to taste like pork, but are more frequently killed as a result of their tendency to steal the eggs of poultry and game birds. This has caused certain populations of the nine-banded armadillo to become threatened, although the species as a whole is under no immediate threat. They are also valuable for use in medical research, as they are the only other mammal susceptible to the human disease leprosy.

They forage for meals by thrusting their snouts into loose soil and leaf litter and frantically digging in erratic patterns, stopping occasionally to dig up grubs, beetles (perhaps the main portion of this species' prey selection), ants, termites, and worms, which their sensitive noses can detect through 8 in of soil. They then lap up the insects with their sticky tongues. Nine-banded armadillos have been observed to roll about on ant hills to dislodge and consume the resident ants. They supplement their diets with amphibians and small reptiles, especially in more wintery months when such prey tends to be more sluggish, and occasionally bird eggs and baby mammals. Carrion is also eaten, although perhaps the species is most attracted to the maggots borne by carcasses rather than the meat itself. Less than 10% of the diet of this species is composed by nonanimal matter, though fungi, tubers, fruits, and seeds are occasionally eaten.Chapman, J. and Feldhamer, G.

They are extensive burrowers, with a single animal sometimes maintaining up to 12 burrows on its range. These burrows are roughly 8 in wide, 7 ft deep, and 25 ft long. Armadillos mark their territory with urine, feces, and excretions from scent glands found on the eyelids, nose, and feet. Females tend to have exclusive, clearly defined territories. Males have larger territories, but theirs often overlap, and can coincide with the ranges of several females. Territorial disputes are settled by kicking and chasing. When they are not foraging, armadillos shuffle along fairly slowly, stopping occasionally to sniff the air for signs of danger. PredationIf alarmed, nine-banded armadillos can flee with surprising speed. Occasionally, a large predator may be able to ambush the armadillo before it can clear a distance, and breach the hard carapace with a well-placed bite or swipe. If the fleeing escape fails, the armadillo may quickly dig a shallow trench and lodge itself inside. Predators are rarely able to dislodge the animal once it has burrowed itself, and abandon their prey when they cannot breach the armadillo\u2019s armor or are grasp its tapered tail. Due to their softer carapaces, juvenile armadillos are more likely to fall victim to natural predation and their cautious behavior generally reflects this. Young nine-banded armadillos tend to forage earlier in the day and are more wary of the approach of an unknown animal (including humans) than are adults. Their known natural predators include cougars (perhaps the leading predator), maned wolves, coyotes, black bears, red wolves, jaguars, alligators, bobcats, and large raptors. By far the leading predator of nine-banded armadillos today is humans, as armadillos are locally harvested for their meat and shells and many thousands fall victim to auto accidents every year.Moeller, W.

This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection. Instead, they are covered by tough skin and a layer of coarse hair. The vertebrae attach to the carapace. The claws on the middle toes of the forefeet are elongated for digging, though not to the same degree as those of the much larger giant armadillo of South America. Their low metabolic rate and poor thermoregulation make them best suited for semitropical environments. Unlike the South American three-banded armadillos, the nine-banded armadillo cannot roll itself into a ball. It is, however, capable of floating across rivers by inflating its intestines, or by sinking and running across riverbeds. The second is possible due to its ability to hold its breath for up to six minutes, an adaptation originally developed for allowing the animal to keep its snout submerged in soil for extended periods while foraging. Although nine is the typical number of bands on the nine-banded armadillo, the actual number varies by geographic range. Armadillos possess the teeth typical of all sloths and anteaters.

It is the sole surviving member of the family Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20\u201326 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15\u201320 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized: the Atlantic walrus, O. r. rosmarus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific walrus, O. r. divergens (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago. These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic. From there, it presumably recolonized the North Pacific Ocean during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway.An isolated population in the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities, including many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to be a third subspecies, O. r. laptevi (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia. Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate until 2009, when multiple lines of molecular evidence showed it to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus."}, {"description": "Conservation In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European sealers and whalers, leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population. Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples continue to kill small numbers towards the end of each summer.Traditional hunters used all parts of the walrus. The meat, often preserved, is an important winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in Russia, the United States, Canada, and Denmark, and representatives of the respective hunting communities. An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific walruses are harvested in Alaska and in Russia, including a significant portion (about 42%) of struck and lost animals. Several hundred are removed annually around Greenland. The sustainability of these levels of harvest is difficult to determine given uncertain population estimates and parameters such as fecundity and mortality. The Boone and Crockett Big Game Record book has entries for Atlantic and Pacific walrus.

The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska.Revkin, Andrew C..

However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as \"least-concern\" by the IUCN, while the third is \"data deficient\". The Pacific walrus is not listed as \"depleted\" according to the Marine Mammal Protection Act nor as \"threatened\" or \"endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act. The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian Red Book. Global trade in walrus ivory is restricted according to a CITES Appendix 3 listing. Culture The walrus plays an important role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus \u2013 possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk, and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best-known appearance is in Lewis Carroll's whimsical poem \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" that appears in his 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass. In the poem, the eponymous antiheroes use trickery to consume a great number of oysters. Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus's appetite for bivalve mollusks, oysters, primarily nearshore and intertidal inhabitants, in fact comprise an insignificant portion of its diet, even in captivity.The \"walrus\" in the cryptic Beatles song I Am the Walrus is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem.Another appearance of the walrus in literature is in the story \"The White Seal\" in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, where it is the \"old Sea Vitch\u2014the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep\".Kipling, Rudyard.

They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays. The females join them and copulate in the water.Gestation lasts 15 to 16 months. The first three to four months are spent with the blastula in suspended development before it implants itself in the uterus. This strategy of delayed implantation, common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival. Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh 45 to at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers. Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most every two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped. MigrationThe rest of the year (late summer and fall), walruses tend to form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic.

Its first part is thought to derive from a word such as Dutch walvis 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for 'horse'.Dictionary.com. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved 16 September 2011. For example, the Old Norse word hrossvalr means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross.Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966 An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal 'shore' and reus 'giant'.Etymology of mammal names. Iberianature.com (29 December 2010). Retrieved 16 September 2011.The species name rosmarus is Scandinavian. The Norwegian manuscript Konungsskuggsja, thought to date from around AD 1240, refers to the walrus as \"rosmhvalr\" in Iceland and \"rostungr\" in Greenland (walruses were by now extinct in Iceland and Norway, while the word evolved on in Greenland). Several place names in Iceland, Greenland and Norway may originate from walrus sites: Hvalfjord, Hvallatrar and Hvalsnes to name some, all being typical walrus breeding grounds.The archaic English word for walrus\u2014morse\u2014is widely thought to have come from the Slavic languages,morse, n., etymology of The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989.

Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of mor\u017e, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.The coincidental similarity between morse and the Latin word morsus (\"a bite\") supposedly contributed to the walrus's reputation as a \"terrible monster\".The compound Odobenus comes from odous (Greek for 'tooth') and baino (Greek for 'walk'), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. The term divergens in Latin means 'turning apart', referring to their tusks."}, {"description": "Range and habitat The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, and the western part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses, based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland. The Atlantic walrus once ranged south to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and as late as the eighteenth century was found in large numbers in the greater Gulf of St. Lawrence region, sometimes in colonies of up to 7,000 to 8,000 individuals.Bolster, W. Jeffrey. The Mortal Sea: Fishing the Atlantic in the Age of Sail. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2012 This population was nearly eradicated by commercial harvest; their current numbers, though difficult to estimate, probably remain below 20,000.[NAMMCO] North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission. 1995. Report of the third meeting of the Scientific Committee. In: NAMMCO Annual Report 1995, NAMMCO, Troms\u00f8, pp. 71\u2013127. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador as having been eradicated in Canada.The isolated population of Laptev walruses is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the eastmost regions of the Kara Sea, and the westmost regions of the East Siberian Sea. The current population of these walruses has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.The limited diving abilities of walruses brings them to depend on shallow waters (and the nearby ice floes) for reaching their food supply. Diet Walruses prefer shallow shelf regions and forage primarily on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms. They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80\u00a0m (260\u00a0ft). They can remain submerged for as long as half an hour.The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is under debate. There have been isolated observations of walruses preying on seals up to the size of a 200 kg bearded seal. Rarely, incidents of walruses preying on seabirds, particularly the Br\u00fcnnich's Guillemot Uria lomvia, have been documented. Walruses may occasionally prey on ice-entrapped narwhals and scavenge on whale carcasses but there is little evidence to prove this. PredationDue to its great size and tusks, the walrus has only two natural predators: the killer whale (orca) and the polar bear. The walrus does not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diets. Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves. The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus, typically younger or infirm animals. The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice. However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare. Walruses have been known to fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage. Polar bear\u2013walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting, and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus. Orcas regularly attack walrus, although walruses are believed to have successfully defended themselves via counterattack against the larger cetacean. However, orcas have been observed successfully attacking walruses with few or no injuries."}, {"description": "While some outsized Pacific males can weigh as much as 2000 kg, most weigh between 800 and. An occasional male of the Pacific subspecies far exceeds normal dimensions. In 1909, a walrus hide weighing 500 kg was collected from an enormous bull in Franz Josef Land, while in August 1910, Jack Woodson shot a 4.9 m long walrus, harvesting its 450 kg hide. Since a walrus's hide usually accounts for about 20% of its body weight, the total body mass of these two giants is estimated to have been at least 2300 kg. The Atlantic subspecies weighs about 10\u201320% less than the Pacific subspecies. Male Atlantic Walrus weigh an average of 900 kg.Walrus: Physical Characteristics. Seaworld.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened snout. Females weigh about two-thirds as much as males, with the Atlantic females averaging 560 kg, sometimes weighing as little as 400 kg, and the Pacific female averaging 800 kg.Carling, M. (1999). Odobenus rosmarus walrus. Animal Diversity Web Length typically ranges from 2.2 to.Walrus. Odobenus rosmarus . National Geographic Newborn walruses are already quite large, averaging 33 to in weight and 1 to in length across both sexes and subspecies. All told, the Walrus is the third largest pinniped species, after the two elephant seals. Walruses maintain such a high body weight because of the blubber stored underneath their skin. This blubber keeps them warm and the fat provides energy to the walrus.The walrus's body shape shares features with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species appears to be more suited for short-range. Tusks and dentitionThe most prominent feature of the walrus is its long tusks. These are elongated canines, which are present in both male and female walruses and can reach a length of 1 m (3\u00a0ft 3 in) and weigh up to 5.4\u00a0kg (12\u00a0lb). Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, which use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice. Tusks were once thought to be used to dig out prey from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging. While the dentition of walruses is highly variable, they generally have relatively few teeth other than the tusks. The maximal number of teeth is 38 with dentition formula: , but over half of the teeth are rudimentary and occur with less than 50% frequency, such that a typical dentition includes only 18 teeth VibrissaeSurrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial vibrissae'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length, though in the wild they are often worn to much shorter lengths due to constant use in foraging. The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves, making them highly sensitive organs capable of differentiating shapes 3 mm thick and 2 mm wide. SkinAside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to 10 cm around the neck and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to 15 cm thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a secondary sexual characteristic, males also acquire significant nodules, called \"bosses\", particularly around the neck and shoulders.The walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a floatation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large baculum (penis bone), up to 63 cm in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size."}, {"description": "The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) is a large flippered marine mammal with a discontinuous distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. The walrus is the only living species in the Odobenidae family and Odobenus genus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies: the Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.Adult walruses are easily recognized by their prominent tusks, whiskers, and bulkiness. Adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 2000 kgWalrus: Physical Characteristics. seaworld.org and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a \"keystone species\" in the Arctic marine regions.The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference."}]}

When forage is stressed by grazing, drought, or herbicides, they change their diets quickly. Grasses are preferred over forbs, and may comprise more than 75% of their diets, especially during summer. Western wheatgrass, buffalo grass, blue grama and sedges (Carex spp.) are preferred during spring and summer. Scarlet globemallow (Sphaeralcea coccinea) and Russian thistle (Salsola kali) are preferred during late summer and fall, but are sought out during every season.

Research suggests black-tailed prairie dogs are a keystone species in some, but not all, geographic areas. Black-tailed prairie dogs enhance the diversity of vegetation, vertebrates, and invertebrates through their foraging and burrowing activities and by their presence as prey items. Grasslands inhabited by black-tailed prairie dogs support higher biodiversity than grasslands not occupied by them. See Ceballos and others for a simplified diagram of black-tailed prairie dog activities and impacts in grassland ecosystem function and biological diversity.Hundreds of species of vertebrates and invertebrates are associated with black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Vertebrate species richness on their colonies increases with colony size and density. West of the Missouri River in Montana, 40% (100 species) of all vertebrate fauna in prairie habitats rely on black-tailed prairie dog colonies for food, nesting, and/or denning. Rare and declining species, such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox (Vulpes velox), mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) are associated with colonies. Because their foraging activities keep plant development in a suppressed vegetative state with higher nutritional qualities, herbivores, including red deer (Cervus elaphus), American bison, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and domestic cattle often prefer foraging in black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Animals that depend on herbaceous cover in sagebrush habitat, such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.), may be deterred by the decreased vegetative cover on black-tailed prairie dog colonies. For a list of vertebrate species associated with black-tailed prairie dog colonies, see.Biodiversity in shortgrass prairies may be at risk due to the reductions in distribution and occurrence of black-tailed prairie dog. Threats include fragmentation and loss of habitat, unregulated eradication or control efforts, and sylvatic plague. As a result of habitat fragmentation and prairie dog eradication programs, colonies are now smaller and more fragmented than in presettlement times. Agriculture, livestock use, and other development have reduced habitat to 2% of its former range. Fragmented colonies are more susceptible to extirpation, primarily by sylvatic plague. The effect of roads on black-tailed prairie dogs is debatable. Roads may either facilitate or hinder their movement, depending on the landscape setting. Roads may be easy routes for dispersal, but those with heavy automobile use may increase mortality.

Landscape-scale habitat characteristics Black-tailed prairie dogs inhabit grasslands, including short- and mixed-grass prairie, sagebrush steppe, and desert grasslands. Shortgrass prairies dominated by buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyron smithii), and mixed-grass prairies that have been grazed by native and nonnative herbivores are their preferred habitat. Slopes of 2% to 5% and vegetation heights between 3 and 5\u00a0inches (7\u201313\u00a0cm) are optimal for detecting predators and facilitating communication.In the Great Plains region, black-tailed prairie dog colonies commonly occur near rivers and creeks. Of 86 colonies located in Mellette County, South Dakota, 30 were located on benches or terraces adjacent to a creek or floodplain, 30 occurred in rolling hills with a slope more than 5\u00b0, 20 were in flat areas, and six were in badland areas.

Black-tailed prairie dogs were associated with areas intensively grazed by livestock and/or areas where topsoil had been disturbed by human activities in sagebrush-grassland habitat on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge and Fort Belknap Agency, Montana. Roads and cattle trails were found in 150 of 154 black-tailed prairie dog colonies, and colonies were located significantly closer to livestock water developments and homestead sites than randomly located points. Soil Black-tailed prairie dog distribution is not limited by soil type, but by indirect effects of soil texture on moisture and vegetation. Colonies occur in many types of soil, including deep, alluvial soils with medium to fine textures, and occasionally gravel. Soil not prone to collapsing or flooding is preferred. Though they do not select specific types of soil to dig burrows, silty loam clay soils are best for tunnel construction. Surface soil textures in colonies near Fort Collins, Colorado, varied from sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the top 6\u00a0inches (15\u00a0cm), with a sandy clay loam subsoil. In northern latitudes, black-tailed prairie dog colonies commonly occur on south aspects due to the dominance of grasses over shrubs and increased solar radiation during winter. Burrows usually occur on slopes more than 10\u00b0.Koford, Carl B. 1958. Prairie dogs, whitefaces, and blue grama. Wildlife Monographs No. 3. Washington, DC: The Wildlife Society.Black-tailed prairie dogs mix the soil horizons by raising soil from deeper layers to the surface. This may significantly affect the texture and composition of soil at different layers. Their feces, urine, and carcasses also affect soil characteristics. Home range and population densityThe home range and territorial boundaries of black-tailed prairie dogs are determined by the area occupied by an individual coterie. Coteries typically occupy about 1.0 acre (0.4 ha).Population density and growth are influenced by habitat quality and are restricted by topographic barriers, soil structure, tall vegetation, and social conditions. Urbanization and other types of human development may restrict colony size and spatial distribution. Most plains habitats support at least 13 black-tailed prairie dogs/ha. Cover requirements Subterranean burrows created by black-tailed prairie dogs serve as refuges from the external environment and are one of the most important features of their colonies. Burrows are used for breeding, rearing young, and hiding from predators, and are maintained from generation to generation, and serve as stabilizers on the physical and social aspects of the colony. Black-tailed prairie dog nests are located underground in burrows and are composed of fine, dried grass. Nest material is collected throughout the year by both sexes and all age classes. Tunnel depths in central Oklahoma were typically four to five feet (50\u201360\u00a0inches) deep.Wilcomb, Maxwell Jeffers, Jr. 1954. A study of prairie dog burrow systems and the ecology of their arthropod inhabitants in central Oklahoma. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma. Dissertation. Most colonies contain 20 to 57 burrows/acre.The three types of burrow entrances are: dome mounds, rimmed crater mounds, and entrances without structures around them. Entrance features may prevent flooding and/or aid in ventilation. Dome mounds consist of loosely packed subterranean soil spread widely around the entrance of the burrow, and tend to be vegetated by prostrate forbs. Rimmed crater mounds are cone-shaped and constructed of humus, litter, uprooted vegetation, and mineral soil. Black-tailed prairie dogs compact the soil of these mounds with their noses, creating poor sites for seedling establishment.Cincotta, Richard P.; Uresk, Daniel W.; Hansen, Richard M. 1989. Plant compositional change in a colony of black-tailed prairie dogs in South Dakota. In: Bjugstad, Ardell J.; Uresk, Daniel W.; Hamre, R.

Rimmed crater mounds may be used as wallowing sites for American bison. Burrow entrances without structures around them are usually located on slopes more than 10\u00b0. The density of burrow openings depends on both substrate and duration of occupation of an area.Vegetation heights between three and five inches (7\u201313\u00a0cm) and a slope of 2\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 are optimal for detecting predators and facilitating communication among black-tailed prairie dogs. Grazing cattle keep vegetation short in the vicinity of colonies, reducing susceptibility to predators and potentially expanding colony size. Black-tailed prairie dogs were rarely seen feeding more than 16 feet (5 m) from colony edges in Wind Cave National Park."}, {"description": "Black-tailed prairie dogs are diurnal. Above ground activity is reduced when rain or snow is falling and during days when the temperature exceeds 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). They do not hibernate, but may become dormant for short periods."}, {"description": "While black-tailed prairie dogs are often regarded as competitors with livestock for available forage, evidence of impacts on rangelands are mixed. Some research suggests they have either neutral or beneficial effects on rangeland used by livestock; however, their effects on rangelands are not uniform. In Cimarron National Grassland in southwest Kansas and adjacent private lands in Baca County, Colorado, some vegetational differences were detected between areas colonized by black-tailed prairie dogs and uncolonized areas, although not all differences were consistent between sample years. Species richness and diversity indices did not differ among colonized and uncolonized sites in either year, nor did the amount of bare ground. The authors conclude while prairie dogs alter shortgrass prairie such that the vegetation of colonies tends to be distinct from adjacent uncolonized areas, \u201cprairie dogs do not substantially alter the essential character of shortgrass vegetation\u201d. Cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided black-tailed prairie dog colonies in a study in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Cattle used colonies in proportion to the colony's availability, and grazed as intensively on colonies as on areas not occupied by black-tailed prairie dogs.Competitive interactions between black-tailed prairie dogs and domestic livestock for preferred forage species are unclear. Several studies suggest black-tailed prairie dogs avoid eating many plants that livestock prefer, and prefer many plants livestock avoid. Conversely, on shortgrass prairie in Colorado, cattle and black-tailed prairie dogs had a 64% similarity in annual diets.Some changes in plant composition brought about by black-tailed prairie dogs may benefit livestock by encouraging an increase in plants more tolerant of grazing, such as needleleaf sedge (Carex duriuscula), sixweeks grass (Vulpia octoflora), and scarlet globemallow. Grazing by black-tailed prairie dogs may also improve the nutritional qualities of some plants. On a shortgrass prairie near Fort Collins, Colorado, plant species diversity was greater inside black-tailed prairie dog colonies than outside of colonies, and perennial grasses such as buffalo grass and forbs increased. While black-tailed prairie dog colonies at Wind Cave National Park typically had lower levels of plant biomass and were dominated by forbs, plants growing on prairie dog colonies had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations than plants in mixed-grass prairie outside colonies. Foraging by black-tailed prairie dogs does not significantly affect steer weights. While forage availability and use by cattle decreased in black-tailed prairie dog foraging areas, steer weight was not reduced significantly in either of two years of study at the USDA's Southern Great Plains Experimental Range near Woodward, Oklahoma. Nutrient cycling, increased soil fertility, and subsequent changes in forage quality partly compensated for reduced forage availability."}, {"description": "Major mortality factors include predation, disease, infanticide, habitat loss, poisoning, trapping, and shooting. Survival for the first year was 54% for females and less than 50% for males in Wind Cave National Park. Primary causes of death were predation and infanticide. Infanticide partially or totally eliminated 39% (361 individuals) of all litters. Lactating females were the most common killers. Mortality of young was highest due to heavy predation during the winter and early spring following birth. Mortality increases with dispersal from a colony or coterie.Sylvatic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can quickly eliminate entire black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Once infected, death occurs within a few days. Black-tailed prairie dogs are also susceptible to diseases transmitted by introduced animals.Brown, David E.; Davis, Russell. 1998.

MatingMinimum breeding age for the black-tailed prairie dog is usually two years, but yearlings may breed if space and food are abundant. In Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, 40% (213 individuals) of yearling females copulated and 9% successfully weaned a litter.The mating season occurs from late February through April, but varies with latitude and site location of the colony. Estrus occurs for only one day during the breeding season. Reproductive successIn Wind Cave National Park, the mean percentage of adult females that weaned a litter each year was 47% \u00b1 14%. Reproductive success and survival may be greater in young colonies that have space for expansion. In a young colony (five years) with space for expansion, in Wind Cave National Park, 88% females were pregnant and 81% of young weaned, compared to an old colony (30 years) with no room for expansion, where 90% of females were pregnant and 41% of young were weaned. Gestation period and litter sizeBlack-tailed prairie dog gestation is 34 days. Parturition occurs underground. Information about litter size at time of birth is unavailable, but the mean litter size observed above ground ranges from 3.0 to 4.9 young/litter. Only one litter is produced each year.Hoogland, John L.; Angell, Diane K.; Daley, James G.; Radcliffe, Matthew C. 1988. Demography and population dynamics of prairie dogs.

DevelopmentIn captivity, black-tailed prairie dog pups open their eyes at 30 days old. Pups are altricial and remain below ground for up to seven weeks to nurse. Maturity is complete at 15 months old. Lifespan of the black-tailed prairie dog in the wild is unknown, but males more than three years old experience high mortality. Females may live longer than males. According to Hoogland and others, lifespan is about five years for males and seven years for females."}, {"description": "Black-tailed prairie dogs live in colonies. Colony size may range from five to thousands of individuals, and may be subdivided into two or more wards, based on topographic features, such as hills. Wards are usually subdivided into two or more coteries, which are composed of aggregates of highly territorial, harem-polygynous social groups. Individuals within coteries are amicable with each other and hostile towards outside individuals. At the beginning of the breeding season, a coterie is typically composed of one adult male, three to four adult females, and several yearlings and juveniles of both sexes. After the breeding season and prior to dispersal of juveniles, coterie size increases. DispersalReasons for dispersal include new vegetative growth at colony peripheries, shortage of unrelated females in a coterie, harassment of females by juveniles, and probably an innate genetic mechanism responding to increased density within a colony. Males typically leave the natal territory 12 to 14 months after weaning, during May and June, but dispersal may occur throughout the year. Females generally remain in their natal coterie territories for their lifetimes. Intercolony dispersers moved an average distance of 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) from their natal site. Roads and trails may facilitate black-tailed prairie dog dispersal. CommunicationConstantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a sophisticated system of vocal communication to describe specific predators.Slobodchikoff, C. N. (2002) \"Cognition and Communication in Prairie Dogs\", In: The Cognitive Animal (pp. 257-264), M. Beckoff, C. Allen, and G. M. Burghardt (eds) Cambridge: A Bradford Book. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information as to what the predator is, how big it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also asserts prairie dogs have calls for things that are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.There is debate over whether the alarm calling of prairie dogs is selfish or altruistic. Prairie dogs possibly alarm others to the presence of a predator so they can protect themselves. However, the calls possibly are meant to cause confusion and panic in the groups and cause the others to be more conspicuous to the predator than the caller. Studies of black-tailed prairie dogs suggest alarm calling is a form of kin selection, as a prairie dog\u2019s call alerts both offspring and kin of indirect descent, such as cousins, nephews and nieces. Prairie dogs with kin close by called more often than those that did not. In addition, the caller may be trying to make itself more noticeable to the predator. However, a predator seems to have difficulty determining which prairie dog is making the call due to its \"ventriloquistic\" nature. Also, when a prairie dog makes a call, the others seem to not run into the burrows, but stand on the mounds to see where the predator is, making themselves visible to the predator.Hoogland, J.L. (1995) The Black- tailed Prairie Dog: Social Life of a Burrowing Mammal, Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago PressPerhaps the most conspicuous prairie dog communication is the territorial call or \"jump-yip\" display. A prairie dog will stretch the length of its body vertically and throw its forefeet into the air while making a call. A jump-yip from one prairie dog causes others nearby to do the same.Hoogland, J. 1996. Cynomys ludovicianus.

In August of 1494 a ship laid anchor off the mostly barren island of Alta Velo, south of Hispaniola, the party of men went and killed eight seals (Sea Wolves) that were resting on the beach. The second recorded interaction with Caribbean monk seals was Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s discovery of the Dry Tortugas Islands. On June 21, 1513 Ponce de Le\u00f3n discovered the islands, he ordered a foraging party to go ashore, where the men killed fourteen of the docile seals. There are several more records throughout the colonial period of seals being discovered and hunted at Guadelupe, the Alacrane Islands, the Bahamas, the Pedro Cays, and Cuba. As early as 1688 sugar plantations owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals every night in order to obtain oil to lubricate the plantations machinery. A 1707 account describes fisherman slaughtering seals by the hundreds for oil to fuel their lamps. By 1850 so many seals had been killed that there were no longer sufficient numbers for them to be commercially hunted. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries scientific expeditions to the Caribbean encountered the Caribbean monk seal. In December 1886 the first recorded scientific expedition, to research seals, led by H. A. Ward and Professor F. Ferrari Perez as part of the Mexican Geographical and Exploring Survey, ventured to a small collection of reefs and a small cay known as the triangles (20.95\u00b0 N 92.23\u00b0 W) in search of Monachus tropicalis. Although the research expedition was in the area for only four days, forty-two specimens were killed and taken away; the two leaders of the expedition shared them. Two specimens from this encounter survive intact at the British Museum of Natural History and the Cambridge Zoological Museum respectively. The expedition also captured a newly born seal pup that died in captivity a week later. The first Caribbean monk seal to live in captivity for an extended period was a female seal that lived in The New York Aquarium. The seal was captured in 1897 and died in 1903, living in captivity for a total of five and one-half years. In 1909 The New York Aquarium acquired four Caribbean monk seals, three of which were yearlings (between one and two years old), and the other a mature male.The final extinction of the Caribbean monk seal was triggered by two main factors. The most visible factor, contributing to the Caribbean monk seals demise, was the nonstop hunting and killing, of the seals, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber. The insatiable demand for seal products in the Caribbean encouraged hunters to slaughter the Caribbean monk seals by the hundreds. The Caribbean monk seals\u2019 docile nature and lacking flight instinct in the presence of humans made it very easy for anyone who wanted to kill one to do so. The second factor was the over fishing of the reefs that sustained the Caribbean monk seal population, with no fish, or mollusks to feed on the seals that were not killed by hunters for oil died of starvation or simply did not reproduce as a result of an absence of food. Surprisingly little was done towards attempting to save the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967 it was likely already extinct."}, {"description": "Caribbean monk seals were found in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean.

This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs."}, {"description": "Historical records suggest that this species may have \"hauled out\" at sites (resting areas on land) in large social groups (typically 20-40 animals) of up to 100 individuals throughout its range. The groups may have been organized based on age and life stage differences. Their diet most likely consisted of fish and crustaceans.Like other true seals, the Caribbean monk seal was sluggish on land. Its lack of fear for man and an unaggressive and curious nature also contributed to its demise."}, {"description": "The Caribbean monk seal, West Indian seal (Monachus tropicalis), or sea wolf, as early explorers referred to it, was a species of seal native to the Caribbean and now believed to be extinct. The Caribbean monk seals' main predators were sharks and humans. Overhunting of the seals for oil, and overfishing of their food sources, are the established reasons for the seals' extinction. The last confirmed sighting of the Caribbean Monk Seal was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank, between Jamaica and Nicaragua. In 2008 the species was officially declared extinct after an exhaustive five-year search for the seals, conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Marine Fisheries Service. Caribbean Monk Seals were closely related to the Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi), which live around the Hawaiian Islands, and are critically endangered, and Mediterranean monk seals (Monachus monachus), which are also critically endangered. An estimated 600 Mediterranean monk seals and 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals are alive in the wild.http://www.mom.gr/displayITM1.asp?ITMID=31A collection of Caribbean monk seal bones can be found at the Tropical Crane Point Hammock Museum in Key Vaca."}]}

Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America, although some small, late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa.Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles, pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales. Fossil evidence from some ophiacodonts shows that parts of the skin was covered in rows of osteoderms, presumably overlain by horny scutes. The belly was covered in rectangular scutes, looking like those present in crocodiles.Carroll, R.L. (1969). \"Problems of the origin of reptiles.\" Biological Reviews, 44: 393-432. Parts of the skin not covered in scutes could have had naked, glandular skin like that found in some mammals. Dermal scutes are also found in a diverse number of extant mammals with conservative body types, such as in the tails of some rodents, sengis, moonrats, the opossums and other marsupials, and as regular dermal armour with underlying bone in the armadillo. In 1940, the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described (and many illustrated) in an important monograph by Alfred Sherwood Romer and Llewellyn Price.Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the therapsids. For that reason, the term is sometimes avoided by proponents of a strict cladistic approach. Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most Pelycosaurs, along with the Therapsida and the Mammals. In contrast to \"Pelycosaurs\", this is a monophyletic group. Caseasauria refers to a pelycosaur side-branch, or clade, that did not leave any descendants.The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of synapsids that had direct ancestral links with the mammalia, having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate.Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, Edaphosaurus, and Ophiacodon."}, {"description": "The pelycosaurs (from Greek \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03c5\u03be pelyx \"bowl\" or \"axe\" and \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 sauros \"lizard\") are an informal grouping (previously considered an order) composed of basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsid amniotes.

Its name comes from the white hair that spans its head flowing down past the neck. In Spanish, Saguinus oedipus is commonly called \"bichichi\", \"tit\u00ed pielroja\", \"tit\u00ed blanco\", \"tit\u00ed cabeza blanca\", or \"tit\u00ed leoncito\". In German-speaking areas, the cotton-top tamarin is commonly known as \"Lisztaffe\" (literally \"Liszt monkey\") most likely due to the resemblance of its hairstyle with that of Hungarian composer and piano virtuoso Franz Liszt.German Wikipedia articleThe species was first described by Linnaeus in 1758 as Simia oedipus. Linnaeus chose the species name oedipus, which means swollen foot, but as the species does not have particularly large feet, it is unknown why he chose this name. (Linnaeus often selected names from mythology without any particular rationale, and he may have used the name of Oedipus, the mythical Greek king of Thebes, more or less arbitrarily.) In 1977, Philip Hershkovitz performed a taxonomic analysis of the species based on fur coloration patterns, cranial and mandibular morphology, and ear size. He classified Geoffroy's tamarin Saguinus geoffroyi as a subspecies of Saguinus oedipus. Subsequent analyses by Hern\u00e1ndez-Camacho and Cooper (1976), Mittermeier and Coimbra-Filho (1981), and later Grooves (2001) consider the oedipus and geoffroyi types to be separate species.Some researchers, such as Thorington (1976), posit that S. oedipus is more closely related to the white-footed tamarin (S. leucopus) than to S. geoffroyi. This view is supported by Hanihara and Natoria's analysis of toothcomb dental morphology (1987) and by Skinner (1991), who found similarities between S. oedipus and S. leucopus in 16 out of 17 morphological traits considered.This species of white-headed tamarin is thought to have diverged from the other Amazonian forms such as S. leucopus. This is supported by morphological considerations of the transition from juvenile to adulthood, during which the fur coloration patterns change significantly and are similar between the two species. Hershkovitz proposed that the separation of the two species happened in the Pleistocene at the height of the Atrato River, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena. At that time, the area was covered by a sea, which created a geographic barrier that caused the species to diverge through the process of allopatric speciation. Today, the two species are principally separated by the Atrato River."}, {"description": "The cotton-top tamarin is part of the most diminutive family of monkeys, Callitrichidae, the marmosets and tamarins; it weighs 432 g on average. Its head\u2013body length is 20.8 \u2013 while its tail\u2014which is not prehensile\u2014is slightly longer at around 33 \u2013. The species is not sexually dimorphic, the male and female are of a similar size and weight. Members of the Callitrichinae subfamily (including this species) have sharp nails (tegulae) on all digits except the big toes, which have the flat nails (ungulae) common to other primates. Tegulae resemble a squirrel's claws and help with movement through trees.The cotton-top tamarin has a long sagittal crest, consisting of white hairs, from forehead to nape flowing over the shoulders. The skin of the face is black with gray or white bands located above the eyes. These bands continue along the edge of the face down to the jaw. Tamarins are generally divided into three groups by their facial characteristics: hairy-face, mottled-face, and bare-face. The cotton-top tamarin has fine white hairs covering its face, but they are so fine it appears naked, thus is considered a bare-face tamarin. Its lower canine teeth are longer than its incisors, creating the appearance of tusks. Like other callitrichids, the cotton-top tamarin has two molar teeth on each side of its jaw, not three like other New World monkeys.The cotton-top tamarin has fur covering all of the body except the palms of the hands and feet, the eyelids, the borders of the nostrils, the nipples, the anus, and the penis. The back is brown, and the underparts, arms and legs are whitish-yellow. The rump and inner thighs and upper tail are reddish-orange. The fur is distributed with varying densities throughout the body: the genital region (scrotum and pubic zone), axilla, and the base of the tail have lower densities, while the forward region is much higher. Many individuals have stripes or whorls of fur of striking coloration on their throat. The cotton-top also has whiskers on its forehead and around its mouth."}, {"description": "The cotton-top tamarin is restricted to a small area of northwest Colombia, between the Cauca and Magdalena Rivers to the South and East, the Atlantic coast to the North, and the Atrato River to the West. Historically, the entirety of this area was suitable for the cotton-top tamarin, but due to habitat loss through deforestation, it survives in fragmented parks and reserves. One of the most important areas for the cotton-top is the Paramillo National Park, which consists of 460,000 ha of primary and secondary forest.The cotton-top tamarin is found in both primary and secondary forests, from humid tropical forests in the south of its range to tropical dry forests in the north. It is seldom found at altitudes above 400 m, but has been encountered up to 1500 m. It prefers the lower levels of the tropical forests but may also be found foraging on the ground and anywhere between the understory and the canopy. It can adapt to forest fragments and can survive in relatively disturbed habitats. In the dry forests there are pronounced seasons. Between December and April it is dry, while heavy rainfall occurs between August and November which can flood the forest floor. Across its range annual rainfall varies between 500 and."}, {"description": "The cotton-top tamarin has a diet of mainly fruit (40%) and animal material (40%). This includes insects, plant exudates such as gum and sap, nectar, and occasionally reptiles and amphibians. Due to its small body size and high food passage rate its diet must be high-quality and high-energy. Insectivory is common in the cotton-top and the species will hunt for insects using a variety of methods: stealth, pouncing, chasing, exploring holes, and turning over leaves.Tamarins act as seed dispersers in tropical ecosystems. While larger primates eat larger seeds, tamarins eat the smaller ones. The expelled seeds have a higher germination rate than others and it is postulated that when larger seeds are ingested it may help to dislodge and expel intestinal parasites.The cotton-top tamarin is diurnal and sleeps with its social group in trees with foliage cover. The group leaves the sleeping tree together an hour after dawn and spends the day foraging, resting, travelling, and grooming. It is thought the species rises late and increases the speed of its foraging and travelling before dusk to avoid crepuscular and nocturnal predators. Its main predators include raptors, mustelids, felids, and snakes. The cotton-top tamarin is extremely vigilant, always looking for potential predators. When the group is resting, one individual will move apart and act as a lookout to alert the group if it sees a threat.The cotton-top tamarin can live as long as 24 years in captivity, while its life span in the wild averages 13 years."}, {"description": "The wild population is estimated at 6,000 individuals, with 2,000 adults. This species is critically endangered, and was listed in the \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates between 2008 and 2012.\" The publication lists highly endangered primate species and is released every two years by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group (IUCN/SSC PSG). The cotton-top tamarin was not selected for the 2012\u20132014 publication.Habitat destruction through forest clearing is the main cause of this collapse, and the cotton-top has lost more than three-quarters of its original habitat to deforestation, while the lowland forest in which it lives has been reduced to five percent of its historical range. This land is then used for large-scale agricultural production (i.e. cattle) and farming, logging, oil palm plantations, and hydroelectric projects that fragment the cotton-top tamarin's natural range.The illegal pet trade and scientific research have also been cited as factors by the IUCN/SSC PSG. While biomedical studies have recently limited their use of this species, illegal capture for the pet trade still plays a major role in endangering the cotton-top. Before 1976, when CITES listed the species under Appendix I banning all international trade, the cotton-top tamarin was exported for use in biomedical research.In captivity, the cotton-top is highly prone to colitis, which is linked to an increased risk of a certain type of colon cancer. Up to 40,000 individuals were caught and exported for research into those diseases as well as Epstein-Barr virus, for the benefit of humans. The species is now protected by international law. Although there are enough individuals in captivity to sustain the species, it is still critically endangered in the wild.The Proyecto Tit\u00ed (\"Project Tamarin\") was started in 1985 to provide information and support in conservation of the cotton-top tamarin and its habitat in Northern Colombia. Proyecto Tit\u00ed's programs combine field research, education and community programs to spread awareness about this endangered species and encourage the public to participate in its protection. It now has partner status with the Wildlife Conservation Network.In January 2015, two captive cotton-top tamarins at the Alexandria Zoological Park in Alexandria, Louisiana died, when a caretaker left them outside overnight in temperatures as low as 30 Fahrenheit. One other individual survived."}, {"description": "Social systems The cotton-top tamarin is a highly social primate that typically lives in groups of two to nine individuals, but may reach up to thirteen members. These small familial groups tend to fluctuate in size and in composition of individuals and a clear dominance hierarchy is always present within a party. At the head of the group is the breeding pair. The male and female in this pair are typically in a monogamous reproductive relationship, and together serve as the group's dominant leaders.Dominant pairs are the only breeding pair within their groups, and the female will generally have authority over the breeding male. While non-breeding group members can be the leading pair's offspring, immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups. This social grouping in cotton-top tamarins is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure. Cotton-top tamarins exhibit prosocial behavior that benefits other members of the group, and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby the group's subordinate adults help in rearing the offspring of the dominant pair. The dominant female is more likely to give birth to non-identical twins than a singleton so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise the young.To prevent younger, subordinate females within the group from breeding, the dominant female uses pheromones. This suppresses sexual behavior and delays puberty. Unrelated males that join the group can release the females from this reproductive suppression; this may result in more than one female of the group becoming pregnant, however only one of the pregnancies will be successful. Cooperation In cooperative breeding, the effort put into caring for the dominant breeder's offspring is shared by the group members. Parents, siblings, and immigrant adults will share child rearing duties for the breeding pair's young. These duties include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with the group's young. Cotton-top tamarins display high levels of parental investment during infant care. Males, particularly those that are paternal, show a greater involvement in caregiving than do females. Despite this, both male and female infants prefer contact and proximity to their mothers over their fathers. It has been hypothesized that males invest additional support in rearing offspring as a form of courtship to win favor of the group's dominant female. However, evidence indicates that time spent carrying infants does not correlate with a male's overall copulation frequency.Since only one female in a group breeds, heavy investment in infant care ensures that all offspring survive until independence. Accordingly, cotton-top tamarins bear excessive costs in order to care for the group's young. Male carriers, especially paternal carriers, incur large energetic costs for the sake of the group's young. This burden may cause some male cotton-tops to lose up to 10-11% of their total body weight. The large weight loss may occur from reduced food intake as infant carrying inhibits foraging ability for a carrier. The trend of male-carrier weight loss and decreased food intake is in contrast to the dominant female's periovulatory period, when she gains weight after increasing her own food intake and relinquishing much of her infant carrying duties. Altruism While caregiving by males appears to be altruistic, particularly in father cotton-tops, the costs of infant care may in fact be tolerated for selfish reasons. Namely, the costs to male weight and foraging ability may in turn promote consecutive pregnancies in dominant females, thereby providing more offspring bearing the father's genes. Additionally, the cooperative breeding structure of cotton-tops can change with group size and parental experience. First-time fathers spend a greater amount of time carrying the infant than experienced fathers, and in smaller groups fathers do a greater proportion of carrying and feeding the infant than in larger groups where helpers take on more of the work. Total care for infants remains constant with varying group size, and infant outcome is not significantly different in groups that have differing levels of experience in raising offspring.The cooperative breeding hypothesis predicts that cotton-top tamarins engage with this child rearing paradigm, and in turn naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, it is unclear whether the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.Other studies involving cotton-top tamarins have hinted that positive reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are irrelevant in the prosociality of these primates. Some researchers believe these primates tend to cooperate for selfish reasons and in situations where they incur some benefit for themselves. That is, cooperation in cotton-top tamarins can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism.Tamarins in captivity have shown the ability to distinguish other individuals based on cooperative tendencies and past behavior. Cotton-tops ultimately use this information to guide future cooperation. Brief periods of defection tend to cause swift, irreparable breakups between these primates and their cooperators. To avoid this, it is thought that cotton-top tamarins will make economically-driven decisions based on the projected incentives of a potential cooperator. Spite and aggression Despite an expansive array of altruistic behaviors, cotton-top tamarins will engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment. Cotton-top tamarins have been observed to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys who deny them benefits. Further, in captivity these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates who are committed fully to cooperation. Based on this, researchers believe that repeated interactions in a cooperative society like that of the cotton-top tamarin can heighten the chances that an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group. This reaction has also been observed in other species. However, these reciprocal punishments, or relative lack of altruistic actions, may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases the chances of a cotton-top punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action.Another way to look at punishment in cotton-top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The cotton-top tamarin, like many marmosets, other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, will stage aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intra-sexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both sub-adult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.Though aggression can occur within groups, the response towards intruders of another species is much more drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females will typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males are more prone to vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and piloerection. Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females. Communication The cotton-top tamarin vocalizes with birdlike whistles, soft chirping sounds, high-pitched trilling, and staccato calls. Researchers describe its repertoire of 38 distinct sounds as unusually sophisticated, conforming to grammatical rules. Jayne Cleveland and Charles Snowdon performed an in-depth feature analysis to classify the cotton-top's repertoire of vocalizations in 1982. They concluded that it uses a simple grammar consisting of eight phonetic variations of short, frequency-modulated \"chirps\"\u2014each representing varying messages\u2014and five longer constant frequency \"whistles.\" They hypothesize that some of these calls demonstrate that the cotton-top tamarin uses phonetic syntax, while other calls may be exemplars of lexical syntax usage. Each type of call is given a letter signifier; for example, C-calls are associated with finding food and D-calls are associated with eating. Further, these calls can be modified to better deliver information relevant to auditory localization in call-recipients. Using this range of vocalizations, the adults may be able to communicate with one another about intention, thought processes, and emotion including curiosity, fear, dismay, playfulness, warnings, joy, and calls to young. Language acquisition Over the first twenty weeks after a cotton-top tamarin is born, it is not fully capable of producing the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility in cotton-top infants, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like chirps, but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first twenty weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps. This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for cotton-top offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.Castro and Snowdon (2000) observed that aside from inconsistent adult-like chirping, cotton-top infants will most often produce a prototype chirp that differs in vocalization structure from anything seen in the full adult range of vocalizations. Infants are thought to imitate adult speakers, who use differing calls in various contexts, but by using solely the infant prototypical chirp. For instance, adult cotton-tops are known to significantly reduce the amount of general alarm calling in the presence of infants. This is likely adapted so that adults that are close in proximity to the group's young do not attract attention of predators to infant-dense areas. Additionally, infants will reduce their prototype chirping in the presence of predators. Whether infants are shadowing the calling behavior of adults or they are comprehending danger remains unclear. However researchers argue that young cotton-top tamarins are able to represent semantic information regardless of immature speech production.To confirm the notion that language acquisition occurs as a progression of comprehension before production, Castro and Snowdon (2000) showed that infants will respond behaviorally to vocalizing adults in a fashion that indicates they can comprehend auditory inputs. When an adult produces a C-call chirp, used to indicate food preference and when navigating to a food source, an infant will approach the adult caller to be fed but will not use the prototype calling as a proxy for C-calls. This finding argues for the idea that infants are able to understand vocalizations first, and later acquire the ability to communicate with adult vocalizations. General calling Among the typical cotton-top tamarin communicative vocalizations, the combination long call (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) are the most heavily represented in the literature. Combination long calls encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued in the presence of kin when there is a threatening predator. Predators of the cotton-top tamarin include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops will produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.CLCs involve the production of complex sequence multisyllabic vocalizations. Researchers have argued that long calls exhibit individual differences and can thus carry information sufficient for recipient cotton-tops to determine caller identity. Using habituation-discrimination paradigms in language experiments, this theory has been confirmed multiple times in literature. However, the individual syllables within a complete CLC vocalization in isolation of each other do not transfer sufficient information to communicate messages between monkeys. Scientists thus consider the whole, intact string of vocalizations to be the unit of perception for CLCs in the cotton-top tamarin. These examinations may confirm that cotton-tops incorporate a lexical syntax in areas of their communication.Since tamarins can discriminate between predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC are thought to extract various complex signals from this form of communication. Primarily, cotton-tops are able to glean the identity of the cooperating tamarin through differences in individuals' alarm calls. Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire. Alarm call-based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in the cotton-top tamarin. Firstly, an alarm call recipient will be able to identify a cooperating tamarin and, by recognizing who in their group it is, be able to judge the reliability of the AC from past experience. This may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically determine the amount of risk present, and how endangered an individual and their group are.Additionally, being able to localize auditory signals may help determine predator location, especially in the presence of a second alarm call from a different tamarin in the group. This can help confirm predator presence, type (e.g. flying versus ground based), and support the recipient in triangulating a predator's location. In the context of the cotton-top's cooperatively breeding groups, this is postulated as being adaptive for determining the variable risk to one's group members. For example, a call recipient will be able to determine which of its kin are and are not at risk (e.g. young offspring, mates, subordinate, relatives, carriers, etc.) and plan subsequent actions accordingly. Food calls The cotton-top tamarin makes selective, specialized vocalizations in the presence of food. These include the C-call, produced when a cotton-top approaches and sorts through food, and the D-call, which is associated with food retrieval and is exhibited while eating.C-call chirping is believed to be an honest signal for communicating food preference, and a cotton-top tamarin will more often and more rapidly vocalize with these chirps when approaching a highly favored food source. Functionally, this behavior may inform other tamarins of the actions the caller will take in a feeding context and whether a preferable food source is available. Despite this research indicating that food calls may be informative to fellow group mates, other observations of cotton-tops show that quantity and distribution of food and audience do not significantly alter a caller's food-centered vocalizations.The cotton-top tamarin is seen to produce food calls both in the presence and absence of group members. Additionally, response to food calls will be directed back to an original caller independent of visual confirmation of a food source. While this may appear to be a result from a very primitive form of communication, Roush and Snowdon (2005) maintain that the food calling behavior confers some mentally representable information about food to recipient tamarins."}, {"description": "The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) is a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg.

During the daytime, the African manatee dozes in shallow (1\u20132 m deep) water. In countries such as Sierra Leone, African manatees are known to migrate upstream when flooding occurs in June and July. This flooding can lower the availability of food for the manatees and the salinity of waterways. African manatees live in groups of one to six individuals. One reason for the African manatee living in small groups is it has very few natural predators, two of which are sharks and crocodiles."}, {"description": "The shape of an African manatee's body is such that it is \"full around the middle and narrowing to a paddle-shaped tail\". It is grey in colour, with small, colourless hairs around its body. However, algae and other tiny organisms often grow on them, so they appear brown or greenish. Calves, however, are darker in colour when they are very young. In length, African manatees measure up to 4.5\u00a0m (14.6\u00a0ft), and they weigh about 360\u00a0kg (790\u00a0lb). African manatees are extremely slow, moving at between 4.8 and 8.0\u00a0km (3 and 5\u00a0mi) an hour, unless they fear predators, when they can travel at speeds of about 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) an hour. The African manatee's large forelimbs, or flippers, are used to paddle and to bring food to the manatee's mouth, after which the vegetation is chewed by its strong molars, which are the only teeth it has. Each jaw has two vestigial incisors when the manatee is born, which it loses as it matures. If the African manatee's molars happen to fall out, new molars grow in their place. The manatee's flippers, which bear nails, are also used \"to embrace and touch other manatees\". The African manatee does not have any hindlimbs. By looking at the exterior of the African manatee, one would not be able to distinguish it from the American manatee, however it is different from the Amazonian manatee, which has characteristic white markings on its abdomen. Evolution and legendsA form descendents of \"coastal South American trichechids\" of the late time of Pliocene is believed to have \"reached West Africa by way of transoceanic currents, perhaps since the late Pliocene, to give rise to the West African manatee.\"According to people of western Africa, Maame (also spelled Mami) Water, a recurring character in many coastal legends, is a goddess of the sea, and a symbol of wealth and beauty. Contrasting with this depiction, Maame Water also flips over canoes and entices their occupants to come \"down to her watery kingdom\". Scientists from the Institute of Aquatic Biology of the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Wildlife Department in Ghana have drawn the conclusion that Maame Water is not a sea goddess, in fact, but the West African manatee. According to Dr. Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, who performs research for CSIR, \"the female manatee looks like a woman when they [sic] surface to inhale fresh air at night.\" Entsua-Mensah said \"because of the breast with teats, when people sight the mammals jumping out of the sea in the night to take in long deep breath of air, they are perceived as half woman, half fish.\" It was not allowed to openly speak of the sacred goddess Maame Water except after certain rituals. In Nigeria, stories are passed through generations concerning \"persons whose fortunes have changed dramatically when they married Maame Water, the mermaid, but lost everything when they became unfaithful to her\"."}, {"description": "The African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), also known as the West African manatee or seacow, is a species of manatee; it is mostly herbivorous (eats plants). African manatees can be found in much of the western region of Africa, from Senegal to Angola. Scientists do not know a lot about this species, but they hypothesize the African manatee is very similar to the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus)."}, {"description": "Although generally speaking, manatees are herbivores, the African manatee also eats clams, mollusks, and fish they find in nets. The majority of the diet of the African manatee is composed of many different types of flora found above or hanging over the water, instead of submerged. African manatees inhabiting rivers eat mostly overhanging plants growing on the river banks. The diets of African manatees living in estuaries consist of just mangrove trees. Each day, the African manatee will eat about 4 to 9 percent of its body weight in wet vegetation. Microorganisms in the African manatee's long large intestine (which measures up to 20 m in length) aid the manatee in digesting the large quantity and variety of vegetation it takes in every day."}, {"description": "African manatees can be found in much of the western region of Africa such as in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. Not only are these manatees found in many countries, but also in bodies of water ranging from brackish to freshwater. They can be found in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and calm shallow bays on the coast. However, a limiting factor of where the African manatee can live is temperature. It is very rare to find an African manatee in water with a temperature below Some are located along the west coast of Africa, in the southeastern and central eastern waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Manatees have been found as far offshore as 75 km out, where there are shallow coastal flats and calm mangrove creeks filled with seagrass. Lakes where they dwell include Lake Volta, Inner Niger River Delta in Mali, Lake L\u00e9r\u00e9, and Lake de Tr\u00e9n\u00e9. Due to fluctuating flow rates and water levels in rivers, some of these permanent lakes serve as refuges, during the dry season, to manatees in connecting rivers. From north to south, the river systems that they can be found include the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mans\u00f4a, Geba, Buba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavalla, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Como\u00e9, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Katsena Ala, Bani, Akwayafe, Rio del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logon\u00e9, Mit\u00e9m\u00e9l\u00e9, Gabon, Ogou\u00e9, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Congo, Dande, Bengo, and Cuanza. They go up these rivers until they are unable to proceed due to water that is too shallow for them to swim through or strong waterfalls they cannot pass.One way African manatees are like West Indian manatees is they both need habitats with protected water and access to food and fresh water. They occasionally journey to less-sheltered areas. Of all of their habitats in Africa, the most populated areas seem to be Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the southern portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, Sanaga River in Cameroon, coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. A study was done in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to find where most African manatees favoured living. They were radio-tagged and tracked, and then they were sighted the most in coastal lagoons with plenty of their main food source, mangroves and other herbaceous growths. They were also found in grass-lined estuaries of big rivers with plenty of mangroves, and in protected coastal spots with less than 3 m of water, again, with bountiful mangroves and also marine macrophytes."}, {"description": "One cannot tell the sex of an individual African manatee without closely examining the manatee's underside. The only visible distinctions between males and females are the genital openings. However, males tend to be smaller than females. Some female African manatees are sexually mature as young as three years of age, and they give birth every three to five years of their estimated 30-year life span. Males take a much longer time to mature, about 9 to 10 years. Rarely will a male African manatee be able to fertilise an egg at two or three years old. African manatees breed at all times of the year. When males and females mate, it is not for life; multiple males will usually mate with one female. Males fight with each other by pushing and shoving when the opportunity to mate with a female is at stake. Female African manatees give birth to one calf at a time after being pregnant for about 13 months, and calves can swim on their own at birth. Although the African manatee's social organisation is not well known, research has shown the most common and tightly knit bonds are between a mother and her calf."}, {"description": "The African manatee was officially declared a species under the Trichechus senegalensis taxon in 1795 by the naturalist, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. No subspecies of this taxon are known, but unreliable claims have been made that there are morphological disparities between coastal manatee populations and isolated inland populations. After more research, no genetic evidence supports these claims and form any subspecies. The African manatee falls under the Trichechus genus with only two other species, the Amazonian manatee and the West Indian manatee, which are also sirenians."}, {"description": "The African manatee has become a vulnerable species because its meat, oil, bones (used to make walking stick handles and \"spinning-tops used in a local game called cii\"), and skin can bring great wealth to poachers. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Camaroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries would easily notice the manatee meat being sold on the streets and marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement prevents the poachers from being punished. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions.Urban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in rivers in countries such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana are more threats to the African manatee's habitat and life, and thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause them to have a deadly run-in with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, often strand manatees in an unsuitable habitat, and some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and nets intended for catching sharks.Some behaviours of African manatees provoke humans' desires to hunt them. When they get tangled up in fishing nets, the animals can do damage to the nets. People in countries such as Sierra Leone feel if they kill and therefore reduce the number of African manatees, the chances of their nets requiring expensive repairs will be lessened. In addition, African manatees have been known to destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season, which is another reason for humans to want to kill them. ConservationFrom November 2004 until December 2007, the West African Manatee Conservation Project completed Phase I. During this phase, residents of six African countries (Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone) put together a database of previously unknown information about the species (such as population, economic value, and habitat range) by conducting surveys in their countries. Other African countries also contributed reports that broadened knowledge of the African manatee. Because of the work done during this phase, the general public, young children, and experienced scientists alike are receiving better information than ever before as to how to protect the African manatees. Phase I also allowed for up-close examination of the African manatee's way of life through field work.Due to the large-scale success of Phase I, a Phase II is to be enacted by Wetlands International. During Phase II, the information collected in Phase I will be even more widely distributed around the areas in which the African manatee lives, and the second phase will focus on \"improving legislation and developing research, communication, and education.\" \"The African manatee is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)\", which states that trade in any species on the list is to be very carefully watched out for and terminated. Laws protect the African manatee in every country in which it lives. However, laws will do nothing if they are not enforced, which is unfortunately the case with the African manatee. Due to mass lack of enforcement and education, the African manatee population is still being steadily depleted."}, {"description": "Der Afrikanische Manati (Trichechus senegalensis) ist eine Seekuhart aus der Familie der Rundschwanzseek\u00fche (Trichechidae).

In Israel, the rock hyrax is reportedly rarely preyed upon by terrestrial predators, as their system of sentries and their reliable refuges provide considerable protection. Hyrax remains are almost absent from the droppings of wolves in the Judean Desert. Feeding and foraging Hyraxes feed on a wide variety of different plants, including Lobelia and broad-leafed plants.http://natureniche.tripod.com/hyrax.html They also have been reported to eat insects and grubs. The rock hyraxes forage for food up to about 50 metres from their refuge, usually feeding as a group and with one or more acting as sentries from a prominent lookout position. On the approach of danger, the sentries give an alarm call, and the animals quickly retreat to their refuge.Kotler, B. P., Brown, J. S. & Knight, M. H. (1999). Habitat and patch use by hyraxes: there's no place like home? Ecology Letters 2 (2): 82\u201388. They are able to go for many days without water due to the moisture they obtain through their food.African Wildlife Foundation: Hyrax Despite their seemingly clumsy build, they are able to climb trees (although not as readily as Heterohyrax), and will readily enter residential gardens to feed on the leaves of citrus and other trees.The rock hyrax also makes a loud grunting sound while moving its jaws as if chewing, and this behaviour may be a sign of aggression. Some authors have proposed that observation of this behavior by ancient Israelites gave rise to the misconception given in Leviticus 11:4-8 that the hyrax chews the cud In fact, hyraxes are not ruminants. ReproductionRock hyraxes give birth to two or three young after a gestation period of 6\u20137 months (long, for their size). The young are well developed at birth with fully opened eyes and complete pelage. Young can ingest solid food after two weeks and are weaned at ten weeks. After 16 months, the rock hyraxes become sexually mature, they reach adult size at three years, and they typically live about ten years. During seasonal changes, the weight of the male reproductive organs (testis, seminal vesicles) changes due to sexual activity. A study showed that between May and January, the males were inactive sexually. From February onward, there was a dramatic increase to the weight of these organs, and the males are able to copulate.Glover, T.D. & Millar, R.P. (1970). Seasonal Changes in the Reproductive Tract of the Male Rock Hyrax. Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 23 (3): 497\u2013499. Social behaviourCaptive rock hyraxes make more than 20 different noises. In a study of their social networks, it was found that hyraxes that live in more \"egalitarian\" groups, in which social associations are spread more evenly among group members, survive longer.Barocas, A., Ilany, A., Koren, L., Kam, M., Geffen, E. (2011). Variance in Centrality within Rock Hyrax Social Networks Predicts Adult Longevity. PLoS ONE 6(7): e22375. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022375 In addition, hyraxes are the first non-human species in which structural balance was described. They follow the \"the friend of my friend is my friend\" rule, and avoid unbalanced social configurations.Ilany, A., Barocas, A., Koren, L., Kam, M., Geffen, E. (2013).

Animal Behaviour 85(6): 1397\u20131405. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.03.032Adults make use of at least 21 different vocal signals. The most familiar signal is a high trill, given in response to perceived danger. Rock hyrax calls can provide important biological information such as size, age, social status, body weight, condition, and hormonal state of the caller, as determined by measuring their call length, patterns, complexity, and frequency.Koren, L. and E. Geffen. (2009). Complex call in male rock hyrax (Procavia capensis): a multi-information distributing channel. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 63 (4): 581\u2013590. More recently, researchers have found rich syntactic structure and geographical variations in the calls of rock hyraxes, a first in the vocalization of mammalian taxa other than primates, cetaceans, and bats. Higher ranked males tend to sing more often, although the energetic cost of singing is relatively low.The rock hyrax spends approximately 95% of its time resting. During this time, they can often be seen basking in the sun, which is thought to be an element of their complex thermoregulation. DispersalMale hyraxes have been categorised into four classes: territorial, peripheral, early dispersers, and late dispersers. The territorial males are dominant. Peripheral males are more solitary and sometimes take over a group when the dominant male is missing. Early-dispersing males are juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late dispersers are also juvenile males, but they leave the birth site much later; around 30 or more months of age.http://www.jaxzoo.org/things/biofacts/RockHyrax.asp"}, {"description": "The rock hyrax occurs across sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of the Congo basin and Madagascar.

The forefeet are plantigrade, and the hindfeet semi-digitigrade. The soles of the feet have large, soft pads that are kept moist with sweat-like secretions. In males, the testes are permanently abdominal, another anatomical feature that hyraxes share with their relatives elephants and sirenians.Thermoregulation in the rock hyrax has been subject to much research, as their body temperature varies with a diurnal rhythm. However, animals kept in constant environmental conditions also display such variation and this internal mechanism may be related to water balance regulation.Meltzer, A.

The closest living relatives to hyraxes are the modern-day elephants and sirenians. The rock hyrax is found across Africa and the Middle East, in habitats with rock crevices in which to escape from predators. Hyraxes typically live in groups of 10\u201380 animals, and forage as a group. They have been reported to use sentries: one or more animals take up position on a vantage point and issue alarm calls on the approach of predators.The rock hyrax has incomplete thermoregulation, and is most active in the morning and evening, although their activity pattern varies substantially with season and climate.Over most of its range, the rock hyrax is not endangered, and in some areas is considered a minor pest. In Ethiopia, Israel and Jordan, they have been shown to be a reservoir of the leishmaniasis parasite."}]}

P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia at the end of the last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. SubspeciesTraditionally, 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognised, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had \"striking, but abnormal\" morphological characteristics. Today, only eight subspecies are usually accepted, although one of these, the Cape lion, formerly described as Panthera leo melanochaita, is probably invalid. Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many. While the status of the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) as a subspecies is generally accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies, therefore all sub-Saharan lions sometimes have been considered a single subspecies, however, a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, Western African lions are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa and a subsequent recolonization of these parts from Asia. Previous studies, which were focused mainly on lions from eastern and southern parts of Africa, already showed these can be possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions from Tsavo in eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in Transvaal (South Africa), than to those in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya. Another study revealed there are three major types of lions, one North African\u2013Asian, one southern African and one middle African. Conversely, Per Christiansen found that using skull morphology allowed him to identify the subspecies krugeri, nubica, persica, and senegalensis, while there was overlap between bleyenberghi with senegalensis and krugeri. The Asiatic lion persica was the most distinctive, and the Cape lion had characteristics allying it more with P. l. persica than the other sub-Saharan lions. He had analysed 58 lion skulls in three European museums.The majority of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes that are extinct in the wild, and might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. It is believed that those lions, imported to Europe before the middle of the nineteenth century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape. Recent Eight recent (Holocene) subspecies are recognised today: P. l. persica, known as the Asiatic lion or South Asian, Persian, or Indian lion, once was widespread from Turkey, across Southwest Asia, to India and Pakistan, now around 400 exist in and near the Gir Forest of India. Genetic evidence suggests its ancestors split from the ancestors of sub-Saharan African lions between 203 and 74 thousand years ago. P. l. leo, known as the Barbary lion, originally ranged from Morocco to Egypt. It is extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting, as the last wild Barbary lion was killed in Morocco in 1942. This was one of the largest of the lion subspecies, with reported lengths of 3.0 \u2013 and weights of more than 200 kg for males. It appears to be more closely related to the Asiatic rather than sub-Saharan lions. A number of animals in captivity are likely to be Barbary lions, particularly the 90 animals descended from the Moroccan Royal collection at Rabat Zoo. P. l. senegalensis, known as the West African lion, is found in western Africa, from Senegal to the Central African Republic.Sunquist, M. E. and Sunquist, F. C. (2009). Family Felidae (Cats). In: Don E. Wilson, Russell A. Mittermeier (eds.): Handbook of the Mammals of the World. Volume 1: Carnivores. Lynx Edicions, 2009, ISBN 978-84-96553-49-1, pp. 137 ff. P. l. azandica, known as the northeast Congo Lion, is found in the northeastern parts of the Congo. P. l. nubica, known as the East African or Masai lion is found in East Africa, from Ethiopia and Kenya to Tanzania and Mozambique; a local population is known as the Tsavo lion. P. l. bleyenberghi, known as the southwest African or Katanga lion, is found in southwestern Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Katanga (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Zambia, and Zimbabwe. P. l. krugeri, known as the southeast African or Transvaal lion, is found in the Transvaal region of southeastern Africa, including Kruger National Park. P. l. melanochaita, known as the Cape lion, became extinct in the wild around 1860. Results of mitochondrial DNA research do not support its status as a distinct subspecies. The Cape lion probably was only the southernmost population of the extant P. l. krugeri. A newly discerned lion subspecies could exist in captivity in Ethiopia's capital city of Addis Ababa. Researchers compared the microsatellite variations over ten loci of fifteen lions in captivity with those of six different wild lion populations. They determined that these lions are genetically unique and presumably that \"their wild source population is similarly unique.\" These lions\u2014with males that have a distinctly dark and luxuriant mane seam to define a new subspecies perhaps native only to Ethiopia. These lions were part of a collection of the late Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. PleistoceneSeveral additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times: P. l. fossilis, known as the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been recovered from Germany and Italy. It was larger than today's African lions, reaching sizes comparable to the American cave lion and slightly larger than the Upper Pleistocene European cave lion. P. l. spelaea, known as the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, occurred in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago. This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes, and at least some had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks, possibly indicating males. P. l. atrox, known as the American lion or American cave lion, was abundant in the Americas from Canada to Peru in the Pleistocene Epoch until about 10,000 years ago. This form is the sister clade of P. l. spelaea, and likely arose when an early P. l. spelaea population became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet about 0.34 Mya. One of the largest purported lion subspecies to have existed, its body length is estimated to have been 1.6 \u2013. Dubious P. l. youngi or Panthera youngi, flourished 350,000 years ago. Its relationship to the extant lion subspecies is obscure, and it probably represents a distinct species. P. l. sinhaleyus, known as the Sri Lanka lion, appears to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939. P. l. vereshchagini, the Beringian cave lion of Yakutia (Russia), Alaska (United States), and the Yukon Territory (Canada), has been considered a subspecies separate from P. l. spelaea on morphological grounds. However, mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from cave lion fossils from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable. P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished during the Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000\u2013600 BC). It inhabited the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub-species. Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly hair in which until recently was only identified in the Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) from captivity in colder climates. Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting in the ancient world. P. l. europaea, known as the European lion, was probably identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula. It was a very popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks. P. l. maculatus, known as the marozi or spotted lion, sometimes is believed to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly coloured individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion hybrid commonly known as a leopon. Hybrids Lions have been known to breed with tigers (most often the Siberian and Bengal subspecies) to create hybrids called ligers and tiglons (or tigons). They also have been crossed with leopards to produce leopons, and jaguars to produce jaglions. The marozi is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow them, their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.Ligers are much bigger than normal lions, typically 3.65 m in length, and can weigh up to 500 kg.The less common tiglon or tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger. In contrast to ligers, tigons are often relatively small in comparison to their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects."}, {"description": "Most lions now live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30\u201350% decline per 20 years in the late half of the 20th century. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002\u20132004, down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered the most significant threats to the species. The remaining populations are often geographically isolated from one another, which can lead to inbreeding, and consequently, reduced genetic diversity. Therefore the lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Asiatic subspecies is endangered. The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from lion populations of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850\u20131,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. Another population in northwestern Africa is found in Waza National Park, where approximately 14\u201321 animals persist. Conservation of both African and Asian lions has required the setup and maintenance of national parks and game reserves; among the best known are Etosha National Park in Namibia, Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and Kruger National Park in eastern South Africa. The Ewaso Lions Project protects lions in the Samburu National Reserve, Buffalo Springs National Reserve and Shaba National Reserve of the Ewaso Ng'iro ecosystem in Northern Kenya. Outside these areas, the issues arising from lions' interaction with livestock and people usually results in the elimination of the former. In India, the last refuge of the Asiatic lion is the 1,412 km2 Gir Forest National Park in western India, which had approximately 180\u00a0lions in 1974 and about 400 in 2010. As in Africa, numerous human habitations are close by with the resultant problems between lions, livestock, locals and wildlife officials. The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project plans to establish a second independent population of Asiatic lions at the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is important to start a second population to serve as a gene pool for the last surviving Asiatic lions and to help develop and maintain genetic diversity enabling the species to survive.The former popularity of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes lions at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent, England that are descended from animals owned by the King of Morocco. Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem. In captivityLions are part of a group of exotic animals that are the core of zoo exhibits since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible.de Courcy, p. 81 Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,de Courcy, p. 82 there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu, Hawaii, died at age 22 in August 2007. His two sisters, born in 1986, were still alive in August 2007. Breeding programs need to note origins to avoid breeding different subspecies and thus reducing conservation value. However, several Asiatic-African lion crosses have been bred. At the ancient Egyptian cities of Taremu and Per-Bast were temples to the lioness goddesses of Egypt, Sekhmet and Bast and at Taremu there was a temple to the son of the deity, Maahes the lion prince, where live lions were kept and allowed to roam within his temple. The Greeks called the city Leontopolis, the \"City of Lions\" and documented that practice. Lions were kept and bred by Assyrian kings as early as 850 BC, and Alexander the Great was said to have been presented with tame lions by the Malhi of northern India. Later in Roman times, lions were kept by emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas or for executions (see bestiarii, damnatio ad bestias, and venatio). Roman notables, including Sulla, Pompey, and Julius Caesar, often ordered the mass slaughter of hundreds of lions at a time. In the East, lions were tamed by Indian princes, and Marco Polo reported that Kublai Khan kept lions inside.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 17. The first European \"zoos\" spread among noble and royal families in the thirteenth century, and until the seventeenth century were called seraglios; at that time, they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 19\u201321, 42. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, Lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the thirteenth century,Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 20. probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his palace in Woodstock, near Oxford; where lions had reportedly been stocked by William of Malmesbury.Blunt, p. 15.Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and elephants, in particular, symbolised power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural \"lords\" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 24\u201328. The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou the wife of Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time.Blunt, p. 16. The menagerie was open to the public by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.Blunt, p. 17. A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century.de Courcy, pp. 8\u20139. The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV, and animals transferred to the London Zoo, which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828.Blunt, p. 32.The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than giant pandas.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 122. Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 114, 117. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 113. Explorers and hunters exploited a popular Manichean division of animals into \"good\" and \"evil\" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures. This resulted in big cats, always suspected of being man-eaters, representing \"both the fear of nature and the satisfaction of having overcome it.\"Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 173, 180\u201383. Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.Blunt, p. 208. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.de Courcy, p. 69. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park. Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam. There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness Elsa, who was raised by George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films. Baiting and taming Lion-baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in Vienna by 1800 and England in 1835.Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore (\"the lions of Mysore\"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903\u20131965)."}, {"description": "Throne Chair of Denmark Throne Chairs of Norway Coat of arms of Denmark Coat of arms of Norway"}, {"description": "The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages, is derived from the Latin ', and the Ancient Greek ('). The Hebrew word () may also be related. It was one of the species originally described by Linnaeus, who gave it the name Felis leo, in his eighteenth-century work, Systema Naturae."}, {"description": "In Africa, lions can be found in savanna grasslands with scattered Acacia trees, which serve as shade; their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub forest. The habitat of lions originally spanned the southern parts of Eurasia, ranging from Greece to India, and most of Africa except the central rainforest-zone and the Sahara desert. Herodotus reported that lions had been common in Greece in 480 BC; they attacked the baggage camels of the Persian king Xerxes on his march through the country. Aristotle considered them rare by 300 BC. By 100 AD they were extirpated.Schaller, p. 5. A population of Asiatic lions survived until the tenth century in the Caucasus, their last European outpost.The species was eradicated from Palestine by the Middle Ages and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily available firearms in the eighteenth century. Between the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, they became extinct in North Africa and Southwest Asia. By the late nineteenth century, the lion had disappeared from Turkey and most of northern India, while the last sighting of a live Asiatic lion in Iran was in 1941 (between Shiraz and Jahrom, Fars Province), although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river, Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province in 1944. There are no subsequent reliable reports from Iran. The subspecies now survives only in and around the Gir Forest of northwestern India. Approximately 400 lions live in the area of the 1,412 km2 sanctuary in the state of Gujarat, which covers most of the forest. Their numbers have increased from 180 to 411 animals mainly because the natural prey species have recovered."}, {"description": "The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong and noble. A common depiction is their representation as \"king of the jungle\" or \"king of beasts\"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness, as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several fables of the sixth century BC Greek storyteller Aesop.Representations of lions date back to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed L\u00f6wenmensch (lion-human) in German. The sculpture has been determined to be at least 32,000\u00a0years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago.Martin Bailey Ice Age Lion Man is world\u2019s earliest figurative sculpture The Art Newspaper, 31 January 2013, accessed 01 February 2013. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also may represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000\u00a0years of age, though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) as their war deities and among those in the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and the Sphinx; The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles. The lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times), where it was strongly associated with kingship. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, is often referred to as the striding lion of Babylon. It is in Babylon that the biblical Daniel is said to have been delivered from the lion's den.Daniel 6 In the Talmud, Chullin 59b, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah tells Emperor Hadrian about the giant lion of the forest of Bei Ilai called the Tigris, a lion so huge that the space between its ears measures 9 cubits. The emperor asks the rabbi to call forth this lion. He reluctantly agrees. At a distance of 400 parasangs from Rome it roars, and all pregnant women miscarry and all the walls of Rome fall down. Then it comes to 300 parasangs and roars, and all the front teeth and molars of Roman men fall out, and even the emperor himself falls from his throne. He begs the rabbi to send it back. The rabbi prays and it returns to its place.In the Puranic texts of Hinduism, Narasimha (\"man-lion\") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or (avatar) of Vishnu, is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee Prahlada from his father, the evil demon king Hiranyakashipu; Vishnu takes the form of half-man/half-lion, in Narasimha, having a human torso and lower body, but with a lion-like face and claws. Singh is an ancient Indian vedic name meaning \"lion\" (Asiatic lion), dating back over 2000 years to ancient India. It was originally only used by Rajputs a Hindu Kshatriya or military caste in India. After the birth of the Khalsa brotherhood in 1699, the Sikhs also adopted the name \"Singh\" due to the wishes of Guru Gobind Singh. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million Sikhs worldwide. Found famously on numerous flags and coats of arms all across Asia and Europe, the Asiatic lions also stand firm on the National Emblem of India. Farther south on the Indian subcontinent, the Asiatic lion is symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala, meaning the \"lion people\" or \"people with lion blood\", while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of Sri Lanka. The Asiatic lion is a common motif in Chinese art. They were first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn Period (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC \u2013 AD 220), when imperial guardian lions started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were wingless, with shorter, thicker bodies, and curly manes. The lion dance is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck.The island nation of Singapore derives its name from the Malay words (lion) and (city/fortress), which in turn is from the Tamil-Sanskrit \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95 singa and \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0 , which is cognate to the Greek , p\u00f3lis. According to the Malay Annals, this name was given by a fourteenth-century Sumatran Malay prince Sang Nila Utama, who, on alighting the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on shore that appeared to be a lion.The name of the nomadic Hadendoa people, inhabiting parts of Sudan, Egypt, and Eritrea, is made up of ha\u0256a 'lion' and (n)\u0256iwa 'clan'. Other variants are Ha\u0256ai \u0256iwa, Han\u0256iwa, and Ha\u0256aat\u02bcar (children of lioness). \"Lion\" was the nickname of several medieval warrior rulers with a reputation for bravery, such as the English King Richard the Lionheart, Henry the Lion, (), Duke of Saxony, William the Lion, King of Scotland, and Robert III of Flanders nicknamed \"The Lion of Flanders\"\u2014a major Flemish national icon up to the present. Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields themselves, or as supporters, but the lioness is much more infrequent. The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specified whether lions or other creatures were \"rampant\" or \"passant\", that is whether they were rearing or crouching. The lion is used as a symbol of sporting teams, from national association football teams such as England, Scotland and Singapore to famous clubs such as the Detroit Lions of the NFL, Chelsea and Aston Villa of the English Premier League, (and the Premiership itself), Eintracht Braunschweig of the Bundesliga, and to a host of smaller clubs around the world.Lions continue to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life international bestselling book of the same title. The lion's role as King of the Beasts has been used in cartoons, from the 1950s manga that gave rise to the first Japanese colour TV animation series, Kimba the White Lion, Leonardo Lion of King Leonardo and His Short Subjects, both from the 1960s, up to the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King, which also featured the popular song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" in its soundtrack. A lion appears on the 50-rand South African banknote."}, {"description": "Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism \u2013 that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard \"spine\" or \"spur\", approximately 5\u00a0mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail \u2013 the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5\u00bd\u00a0months of age and is readily identifiable at 7\u00a0months.Schaller, p. 28.The size of adult lions varies across their range with those from the southern African populations in Rhodesia, Kalahari and Kruger Park averaging around 189.6 kg and 126.9 kg in males and females respectively compared to 174.9 kg and 119.5 kg of male and female lions from East Africa. Reported body measurements in males are head-body lengths ranging from 170 to, tail lengths of 90 \u2013. In females reported head-body lengths range from 140 to, tail lengths of 70 \u2013, however, the frequently cited maximum head and body length of 250 cm fits rather to extinct Pleistocene forms, like the American lion, with even large modern lions measuring several centimetres less in length.Maz\u00e1k, Vratislav (April 2004) Der Tiger, Westarp Wissenschaften, 5th ed., pp. 178 ff., ISBN 3-89432-759-6. Record measurements from hunting records are supposedly a total length of nearly 3.6 m for a male shot near Mucsso, southern Angola in October 1973 and a weight of 313 kg for a male shot outside Hectorspruit in eastern Transvaal, South Africa in 1936.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc (1983), ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9 Another notably outsized male lion, which was shot near Mount Kenya, weighed in at 272 kg. ManeThe mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It may provide an excellent intimidation display; aiding the lion during confrontations with other lions. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favors males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male\u2013male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year. Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the colour and size of a lion's mane, such as the ambient temperature. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.In the Pendjari National Park area almost all males are maneless or have very weak manes.Schoe, Marjolein; Sogbohossou, Etot\u00e9p\u00e9 A.; Kaandorp, Jacques and de Iongh, Hans (2010) Progress Report \u2013 collaring operation Pendjari Lion Project, Benin. Funded by the Dutch Zoo Conservation Fund. Maneless male lions have also been reported from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone has been linked to mane growth, therefore castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production.Cave paintings of extinct European cave lions almost exclusively show animals with no manes, suggesting that either they were maneless, or that the paintings depict lionesses as seen hunting in a group. White lions The white lion is not a distinct subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin to that of the white tiger; the condition is similar to melanism, which causes black panthers. They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion (Panthera leo krugeri) individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is due to a recessive allele. Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts."}, {"description": "Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20\u00a0hours per day.Schaller, p. 122. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50\u00a0minutes eating.Schaller, pp. 120\u201321. Group organization Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature. The lion is a predatory carnivore with two types of social organization. Some lions are residents, living in groups centering around related lionesses, called prides.Schaller, p. 33. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.Schaller, p. 37. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses,Schaller, p. 39. although some females do leave and become nomadic.Schaller, p. 44. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a coalition if more than one) who mate with the adult females. The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two but may increase to as many as four before decreasing again over time. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2\u20133 years of age. The second organizational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males, as a rule, live at least some portion of their lives as nomads, and some are never able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.The area a pride occupies is called a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality \u2013 the most pronounced in any cat species \u2013 has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger. Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride. They are more effective hunters, as they are smaller, swifter, and more agile than the males and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills,Schaller, p. 133. although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible. Near the conclusion of the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses, but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves.Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build.Join the Pride. Lion Conservation Fund. Retrieved on 2013-07-31. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride. Hunting and dietLions prefer to scavenge when the opportunity presents itself with carrion providing more than 50% of their diet.> They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress.Schaller, p. 213. In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.The lionesses do most of the hunting for the pride. The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches over young cubs until the lionesses return from the hunt. Typically, several work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed in on the herd, they usually target the animal closest to them. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by strangulation, which can cause cerebral ischemia or asphyxia (which results in hypoxemic, or \"general\", hypoxia). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia).Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina \u2013 for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight.Schaller, p. 248. Thus, they only run fast in short bursts,Schaller, pp. 247\u201348. and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.Schaller, p. 237. They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30 m or less. The prey consists mainly of medium-sized mammals, with a preference for wildebeest, zebras, buffalo, and warthogs in Africa and nilgai, wild boar, and several deer species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability, mainly ungulates weighing between 50 and such as kudu, hartebeest, gemsbok, and eland. Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as Thomson's gazelle or springbok. Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male giraffes due to the danger of injury. Giraffes and buffaloes are almost invulnerable to a solitary lion as well.Schaller, p. 259.Extensive studies show that lionesses normally prey on mammals with an average weight of 126 kg, while kills made by male lions average 399 kg. In Africa, wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the Serengeti) followed by zebra. Lions do not prey on fully grown adult elephants; most adult hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and smaller gazelles, impala, and other agile antelopes are generally excluded. However, giraffes and buffaloes are often taken in certain regions. For instance, in Kruger National Park, giraffes are regularly hunted. In Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet, due to the high number density of buffaloes. Occasionally hippopotamus is also taken, but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided. Warthogs are often taken depending on availability. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. In the Kalahari desert in South Africa, black-maned lions may chase baboons up a tree, wait patiently, then attack them when they try to escape: Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs, though (unlike most felids) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them. A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30 kg in one sitting; if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more. On a hot day, the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard.Schaller, pp. 270\u201376. An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg of meat per day, a male about 7 kg.Schaller, p. 276. Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the \"wing\" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses. There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush. Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.Schaller, p. 153. Predator competition Lions and spotted hyenas occupy the same ecological niche, meaning they compete for prey and carrion in the areas where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions whether there is food or not. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the Ngorongoro crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. On the other hand, in Northern Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed: hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills: they obtain food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30 \u2013 until the lions have finished,Schaller, p. 272. but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions, and even force the lions off a kill. The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason.Schaller, pp. 273\u2013274. Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent. The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions.Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90% of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.Schaller, p. 293. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.Schaller, p. 188.The Nile crocodile is the only sympatric predator (besides humans) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs. Man-eating While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; one well-publicised case includes the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.In their analysis of Tsavo and general man-eating, Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating, but that the behaviour is \"not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'\" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note that the relationship is well-attested among other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period \u2013 a number far exceeding the more famed \"Tsavo\" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon (when there was less moonlight) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people.Author Robert R. Frump wrote in The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35\u00a0people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region. Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess underneath a molar that was cracked in several places. He further commented that \"This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing.\" GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.The \"All-Africa\" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but incidents in the early 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then Tanganyika (now Tanzania). George Rushby, game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in what is now Njombe district. Reproduction and life cycle Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.Schaller, p. 29. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous.Schaller, p. 174. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat;Schaller, p. 142. during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple copulates twenty to forty times a day, often forgoing eating. Lions reproduce very well in captivity. The average gestation period is around 110\u00a0days, the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept.Scott, p. 45. The cubs themselves are born blind \u2013 their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh 1.2 \u2013 at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.Schaller, p. 143. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes \u2013 consequently, death by starvation is more common among the younger cubs. In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles, and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede toward the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death while warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. All in all, as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two. When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies \u2013 sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.Scott, p. 46. Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4\u20135 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest, if they have not already been critically injured while defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted.Scott, p. 68. Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members.One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact homosexually. Lions are shown to involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. Male Lions will also head rub and roll around with each other before having sex together. HealthAlthough adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions.Schaller, p. 183. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill.Schaller, pp. 188\u201389. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.Schaller, pp. 189\u201390. Various species of tick commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of most lions.Schaller, p. 184. Adult forms of several species of the tapeworm genus Taenia have been isolated from intestines, the lions having ingested larval forms from antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming covered in bloody bare patches and emaciated. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many perished or emigrated as the population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions. Lions, especially in captivity, are vulnerable to the canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. FIV, which is similar to HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and Namibian lions. Communication When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,Schaller, p. 85. which have been compared with grooming in primates.(2007 edition: 0-202-30826-X) Head rubbing \u2013 nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion \u2013 appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.Schaller, pp. 85\u201388. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.Schaller, pp. 88\u201391. Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.Schaller, pp. 92\u2013102. Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing, and roaring. Lions tend to roar in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones. They most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of 8 km, is used to advertise the animal's presence.Schaller, pp. 103\u2013113. Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat."}, {"description": "The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000\u00a0years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30\u201350% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.Lions live for 10\u201314 years in the wild, although in captivity they can live more than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal, although bordering on crepuscular in nature.Lions' nocturnal chorus. Earth-touch.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-31.African Lion Panthera leo. Phoenix Zoo Fact Sheet.Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies."}]}

They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material (especially masts). The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been due to the black bear having evolved alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct short-faced bear and the still living grizzly bear, that monopolized more open habitats and the historic presence of larger predators such as smilodon and the American lion that could have preyed on black bears. Although found in the largest numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, black bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in peri-urban regions as long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage. In most of the contiguous United States, black bears today are usually found in heavily vegetated mountainous areas, from 400 to. For bears living in the American Southwest and Mexico, habitat usually consists of stands of chaparral and pinyon juniper woods. In this region, bears occasionally move to more open areas to feed on prickly pear cactus. At least two distinct, prime habitat types are inhabited in the Southeast United States. Black bears in the southern Appalachian Mountains survive in predominantly oak-hickory and mixed mesophytic forests. In the coastal areas of the southeast (such as Florida and Louisiana), bears inhabit a mixture of flatwoods, bays, and swampy hardwood sites. In the northeast part of the range (United States and Canada), prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of hardwoods such as beech, maple, and birch, and coniferous species. Corn crops and oak-hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the northeast; small, thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of white cedar. Along the Pacific coast, redwood, sitka spruce, and hemlocks predominate as overstory cover. Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for black bears, such as fields of brush, wet and dry meadows, high tidelands, riparian areas and a variety of mast-producing hardwood species. The spruce-fir forest dominates much of the range of the black bear in the Rockies. Important nonforested areas here are wet meadows, riparian areas, avalanche chutes, roadsides, burns, sidehill parks, and subalpine ridgetops. In areas where human development is relatively low, such as stretches of Canada and Alaska, American black bears tend to be found more regularly in lowland regions. In parts of northeastern Canada, especially Labrador, black bears have adapted exclusively to semi-open areas which are more typical habitat in North America for brown bears (likely due to the absence here of brown and polar bears as well as other large carnivore species)."}, {"description": "Historically, black bears occupied the majority of North America's forested regions. Today, they are primarily limited to sparsely settled, forested areas.Black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range, though they do not occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. They have been extinct in Prince Edward Island since 1937. The total Canadian black bear population is between 396,000 and 476,000, based on surveys taken in the mid-1990s in seven Canadian provinces, though this estimate excludes black bear populations in New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan. All provinces indicated stable populations of black bears over the last decade.The current range of black bears in the United States is constant throughout most of the northeast, and down in the Appalachian Mountains almost continuously from Maine to north Georgia, the northern midwest, the Rocky Mountain region, the west coast and Alaska. However it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions. Despite this, black bears in those areas seems to have expanded their range during the last decade, such as with recent sightings in Ohio, though these probably do not represent stable breeding populations yet. Surveys taken from 35 states in the early 1990s indicate that black bears are either stable or increasing, except in Idaho and New Mexico. The overall population of black bears in the United States has been estimated to range between 339,000 and 465,000, though this excludes populations from Alaska, Idaho, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, whose population sizes are unknown.As of 1993, known Mexican black bear populations existed in four areas, though knowledge on the distributions of populations outside those areas have not been updated since 1959. Mexico is the only country where the black bear is classified as \"endangered\".There have been several sightings quite far away from where the black bear is normally found, such as Union County, North Carolina.http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/local/another-black-bear-sighting-union-co/nYTgd/http://www.wcnc.com/story/news/local/2014/08/03/black-bears-make-a-comeback-in-nc/13548689/"}, {"description": "In his Great Bear Almanac, Gary Brown lists 20 different sounds in eight different contexts. Sounds expressing aggression include growls, woofs, snorts, bellows and roars. Sounds expressing contentment include mumbles, squeaks and pants. A black bear has better eyesight and a better sense of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense is the sense of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. American black bears tend to be territorial and non-gregarious in nature. However, at abundant food sources (i.e. spawning salmon or garbage dumps) black bears may congregate and dominance hierarchies form, with the largest, most powerful males dominating the most fruitful feeding spots.Nowak, R.M. (1991) Walker's Mammals of the World. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London. They mark their territories by rubbing their bodies against trees and clawing at the bark. Annual ranges held by mature male black bears tend to be very large but there is some variation. On Long Island off the coast of Washington, ranges average 5 sqmi, whereas on the Ungava Peninsula in Canada ranges can average up to 1,000 sqmi, with some males bears travelling as far as 4,349 sqmi in times of food shortages. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). Black bears climb regularly to feed, escape enemies and to hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of the day or night, although mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Reproduction and developmentSows usually produce their first litter at the age of 3\u20135\u00a0years. Sows living in more developed areas tend to get pregnant at younger ages. The breeding period usually occurs in the June\u2013July period, though it can extend to August in the species' northern range. The breeding period lasts for 2\u20133\u00a0months. Both sexes are promiscuous. Males try to mate with several females but large, dominant ones may violently claim a female if another mature male comes near. Sows tend to be short tempered with their mates after copulating. The fertilized eggs undergo delayed development and do not implant in the female\u2019s womb until November. The gestation period lasts 235\u00a0days, and litters are usually born in late January to early February. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two or three. At birth, cubs weigh 280 -, and measure 20.5 cm in length. They are born with fine, gray, downlike hair, and their hind quarters are underdeveloped. They typically open their eyes after 28\u201340\u00a0days, and begin walking after 5\u00a0weeks. Cubs are dependent on their mother's milk for 30\u00a0weeks, and will reach independence at 16\u201318\u00a0months. At the age of six weeks, they attain 900 g, by 8\u00a0weeks they reach 2.5 kg and by the age of 6\u00a0months they weigh 18 to. They reach sexual maturity at the age of three years, and attain their full growth at 5\u00a0years. Longevity and mortalityThe average lifespan in the wild is 18\u00a0years, though it is quite possible for wild specimens to survive for more than 23 years. The record age of a wild specimen was 31\u00a0years, while that in captivity was 44\u00a0years. Average annual survival rates for adult bears is variable, ranging from 86% in Florida to 73% in Virginia and North Carolina. In Minnesota, 99% of wintering adult bears were able to survive the hibernation cycle in one study. Remarkably, a study of black bears in Nevada found that the amount of annual mortality of a population of bears in wilderness areas was 0%, whereas in developed areas in the state this figure rose to 83%. Survival in subadults is generally less assured. In Alaska, only 14\u201317% of subadult males and 30\u201348% of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood. Across the range, the estimated amount of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%.With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. Black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included bobcats, coyotes, cougars, wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs.Man Says Bear Saved Him From Mountain Lion Attack In Butte County \u00ab CBS Sacramento. Sacramento.cbslocal.com (2012-03-29). Retrieved on 2012-12-21. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bears fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto-collisions also may claim many black bear lives annually. Hibernation Black bears were once not considered true or \"deep\" hibernators, but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow black bears to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as \"specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather\". Black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators.Black bears enter their dens in October and November. Prior to that time, they can put on up to 30\u00a0pounds of body fat to get them through the seven months during which they fast. Hibernation in black bears typically lasts 3\u20135\u00a0months. During this time, their heart rate drops from 40\u201350 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute. They spend their time in hollowed-out dens in tree cavities, under logs or rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions. Females, however, have been shown to be pickier in their choice of dens, in comparison to males. Although naturally-made dens are occasionally used, most dens are dug out by the bear itself. A special hormone, leptin is released into the black bear's systems, to suppress appetite. Because they do not urinate or defecate during dormancy, the nitrogen waste from the bear's body is biochemically recycled back into their proteins. This also serves the purpose of preventing muscle loss, as the process uses the waste products to build muscle during the long periods of inactivity. In comparison to true hibernators, their body temperature does not drop significantly (staying around 35\u00a0degrees Celsius) and they remain somewhat alert and active. If the winter is mild enough, they may wake up and forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts. During winter, black bears consume 25\u201340% of their body weight. The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue. In the most southernly areas (i.e. Florida, Mexico, the Southeastern United States) of the black bear's distribution only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation. After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity. In mountainous areas, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses. Black bears use dense cover for hiding and thermal protection, as well as for bedding. Dietary habits Generally, American black bears are largely crepuscular in foraging active, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% of the black bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time.American Black Bear Fact Sheet \u2013 National Zoo| FONZ. Nationalzoo.si.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-15. During summer, the diet is comprised largely by fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes pretty much the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts become the most important part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazlenuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.The majority of the black bear's animal diet consists of insects such as bees, yellow jackets, ants and their larvae. Black bears are also fond of honey, and will gnaw through trees if hives are too deeply set into the trunks for them to reach them with their paws. Once the hive is breached, black bears will scrape the honeycombs together with their paws and eat them, regardless of stings from the bees. Black bears that live in northern coastal regions (especially the Pacific coast) will fish for salmon during the night, as their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. However, the white furred black bears of the islands of western Canada have a 30% greater success rate in catching salmon than their black furred counterparts. Other fish including suckers, trout and catfish are readily caught when possible.black bear. Pvci.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-20. Although black bears do not often engage in active predation of other large animals for much of the year, the species will also regularly prey on mule and white-tailed deer fawns in spring given the opportunity.Smith, R. (1983). Mule deer reproduction and survival in the LaSal Mountains of Utah, M.S. thesis, Utah State University, Logan. In addition they have been recorded similarly preying on elk calves in Idaho and moose calves in Alaska. Black bear predation on adult deer is rare but has been recorded. They may even hunt prey up to the size of adult female moose, which are considerably larger than themselves, by ambushing them. There is at least one record of a male black bear killing two bull elk over the course of six days by chasing them into deep snow banks where their movement is impeded. In Labrador, black bears are exceptionally carnivorous, living largely off of caribou, usually sickly, young or dead specimens, and rodents such as voles. This is believed to be due to a paucity of edible plant life in this sub-Arctic region and a local lack of competing large carnivores (including other bear species). Like brown bears, black bears try to use surprise to ambush their prey and target the sickly animals in herds. Once a deer fawn is captured, it is frequently torn apart alive while feeding. If able to capture a mother deer in spring, the bear frequently begins feeding on the udder of lactating females, but generally prefer meat from the viscera. Black bears often drag their prey to cover, preferring to feed in seclusion. The skin of large prey is stripped back and turned inside out with the skeleton usually left largely intact. Unlike wolves and coyotes, black bears rarely scatter the remains of their kills. Vegetation around the carcass is usually matted down by black bears and their droppings are frequently found nearby. Black bears may attempt to cover remains of larger carcasses, though they do not do so with the same frequency as cougars and grizzly bears. They will readily consume eggs and nestlings of various birds and can easily access many tree nests, even the huge nest of the bald eagle. Black bears have been reported stealing deer and other animals from human hunters. Interspecific predatory relationshipsOver much of their range, black bears are assured scavengers which, using their large size and considerable strength, can intimidate and, if necessary, dominate other predators in confrontations over carcasses. However, in occasions where they encounter the Kodiak or the grizzly bears, the larger two brown sub-species dominate them. Black bears tend to escape competition from brown bears by being more active in the daytime, and living in more densely forested areas. Violent interactions resulting in the deaths of black bears have been recorded in Yellowstone National Park.Black bears do compete with cougars over carcasses. Like brown bears, they will sometimes steal kills from cougars. One study found that both bear species visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Fights between the two species are rare, though they can be violent. Cougars occasionally kill adult bears, a behavior reportedly witnessed in the 19th century. There are also 19th and early 20th century records of bears killing cougar, either in defense or in territorial disputes, and occasional fights which ended in both combatants fatally wounded.Black bear interactions with wolves are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species\u2032 northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Despite the black bear being more powerful on a one to one basis, packs of wolves have been recorded to kill black bears on numerous occasions without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. Wolf packs typically kill black bears when the large animals are in their hibernation cycle.There is at least one record of a black bear killing a wolverine in a dispute over food in Yellowstone National Park. Black bears may sometimes habitually prey on American alligator nests. Sometimes, they are fought off by the female alligator but will also occasionally wound or even kill an adult alligator, though neither species are likely to confront a large adult of the other directly.Crocodiles: Proceedings of the 6th Working Meeting of the Crocodile Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN publication.

American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears."}, {"description": "Although they live in North America, American black bears are not closely related to brown bears and polar bears; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 million years ago (mya). Both American and Asian black bears are considered sister taxa, and are more closely related to each other than to other species of bear.Craighead, Lance (2003) Bears of the World, Voyageur Press, ISBN 0-89658-008-3 Reportedly, the sun bear is also a relatively recent split from this lineage.Hunter, Luke (2011) Carnivores of the World, Princeton University Press, ISBN 9780691152288A small primitive bear called Ursus abstrusus is the oldest known North American fossil member of the genus Ursus, dated to 4.95 mya. This suggests that U. abstrusus may be the direct ancestor of the American black bear, which evolved in North America.Kurten, B., and E. Anderson (1980). Pleistocene mammals of North America. Columbia University Press, New York, ISBN 0231516967. Although Wolverton and Lyman still consider U. vitabilis an \"apparent precursor to modern black bears\", it has also been placed within U. americanus.The ancestors of American black bears and Asiatic black bears diverged from sun bears 4.58 mya. The American black bear then split from the Asian black bear 4.08 mya.Lisette Waits, David Paetkau, and Curtis Strobeck, \"Overview\" from Genetics of the Bears of the World chapter 3 of Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, compiled by Christopher Servheen, Stephen Herrero and Bernard Peyton, IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group The earliest American black bear fossils, which were located in Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, greatly resemble the Asiatic species, though later specimens grew to sizes comparable to grizzlies. From the Holocene to present, American black bears seem to have shrunk in size, but this has been disputed because of problems with dating these fossil specimens.The American black bear lived during the same period as short-faced bears (Arctodus simus and A. pristinus) and the Florida spectacled bear (Tremarctos floridanus). These Tremarctine bears evolved from bears that had emigrated from Asia to North America 7\u20138 ma. The short-faced bears are thought to have been heavily carnivorous and the Florida spectacled bear more herbivorous, while the American black bears remained arboreal omnivores, like their Asian ancestors. The black bear's generalist behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why, of these three genera, it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through the last ice age while the other more specialized North American predators went extinct. However, both Arctodus and Tremarctos had survived several other ice ages. After these prehistoric Ursids went extinct during the last glacial period 10,000\u00a0years ago, black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the arrival of brown bears to the rest of the continent. HybridsAmerican black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species, and have occasionally produced hybrid offspring. According to Jack Hanna's Monkeys on the Interstate, a bear captured in Sanford, Florida, was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female Asian black bear and a male American black bear.Hybrid Bears. messybeast.com In 1859, a black bear and a Eurasian brown bear were bred together in the London Zoological Gardens, but the three cubs died before they reached maturity. In The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication Charles Darwin noted: In the nine-year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the zoological gardens to couple freely, but previously to 1848 most had rarely conceived. In the reports published since this date three species have produced young (hybrids in one case),...A black bear shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan was thought by some to be a black bear/grizzly bear hybrid, due to its unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull.

Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the shoreline and fell sound asleep. Over the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune. Attacks on humans Although an adult bear is quite capable of killing a human, American black bears typically avoid confronting humans when possible. Unlike grizzly bears, which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and swatting the ground with their forepaws. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of the brown bear in North America, though this is largely because the black species considerably outnumbers the brown rather than greater aggressiveness. Compared to brown bear attacks, aggressive encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and seldom attack humans in their vicinity. However, occasionally, attacks by protective mothers do occur. The worst recorded fatality incident occurred in May 1978, in which a black bear killed three teenagers who were fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada. Another exceptional, spree-like attack occurred in August 1997 in Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park in Canada, when an emaciated black bear attacked a child and mother, killing the mother as well as an adult man who tried to intervene. This bear was shot while mauling a fourth victim.The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to close human proximity and food conditioned. 1,028 incidents of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury, were recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots where people regularly fed the bears handouts.Kruuk, Hans (2002). Hunter and hunted: relationships between carnivores and people, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-89109-4 In almost every case where open dumps or handouts that had previously attracted black bears were ceased, the amount of aggressive encounters with bears have decreased precipitously over time. However, in the aforementioned case of the spree attack in Liard River Hot Springs, the attacking bear was believed to have been previously almost fully dependent on a local garbage dump that had closed and was starving as a result of the loss of that food source. Attempts to relocate bears are typically unsuccessful, as black bears seem to be able to return to their home range even without familiar landscape cues. Livestock and crop predationA limitation of food sources in early spring and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months are probably major contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage in some areas of the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; whether or not this is intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears.Black Bear Attacks Dog. Wjhg.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return.

University of Arkansas uaex.edu Hunting and exploitation Hunting Historically, black bears were hunted by both Native Americans and European settlers. Some Native American tribes, in admiration for the black bear's intelligence, would decorate the heads of bears they killed with trinkets, and place them on blankets. Tobacco smoke would be wafted into the disembodied head's nostrils by the hunter that dealt the killing blow, who would compliment the animal for its courage. The Kutchin typically hunted black bears during their hibernation cycle. Unlike the hunting of hibernating grizzlies, which was fraught with danger, black bears took longer to awaken, and was thus safer and easier. During the European colonisation of eastern North America, thousands of black bears were hunted for their meat, fat and fur. Theodore Roosevelt wrote extensively on black bear hunting in his Hunting the Grisly and other sketches, in which he stated \"in [a black bear] chase there is much excitement, and occasionally a slight spice of danger, just enough to render it attractive; so it has always been eagerly followed\". He wrote that black bears were difficult to hunt by stalking, due to their habitat preferences, though were easy to trap. Roosevelt described how in the Southern States, planters regularly hunted black bears on horseback with hounds. General Wade Hampton was known to have been present at 500 successful black bear hunts, two thirds of which he killed personally. He killed thirty or forty black bears with only a knife, which he would use to stab the bears between the shoulder blades while they were distracted by his hounds. Unless well trained, horses were often useless in black bear hunts, as they often bolted when the bears stood their ground. In 1799, 192,000 black bear skins were exported from Quebec. In 1822, 3,000 skins were exported from the Hudson's Bay Company.Partington, Charles Frederick (1835) The British Cyclop\u00e6dia of Natural History: Combining a Scientific Classification of Animals, Plants, and Minerals, Vol. 1, Orr & Smith. In 1992, untanned, fleshed and salted black bear hides were sold for an average of $165.In Canada, black bears are considered as both a big game and furbearer species in all provinces save for New Brunswick and Northwest Territories, where they are only classed as a big game species. There are currently 80,822 licensed black bear hunters in all of Canada. Canadian black bear hunts take place in the fall and spring, and both male and female bears can be legally taken, though some provinces prohibit the hunting of females with cubs, or yearling specimens.Currently, 28 of the USA's states have black bear hunting seasons. Nineteen states require a bear hunting license, with some also requiring a big game license. In eight states, only a big game license is required to hunt black bears. Overall over 481,500 black bear hunting licences are sold per year. The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state, with some bear hunting seasons including fall only, spring and fall, or year-round. New Jersey, in November 2010, approved of a six-day bear-hunting season in early December 2010 to slow the growth of the black bear population. Bear-hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that 53% of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded black bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property. Men, older voters, and those living in rural areas were more likely to approve of a bear-hunting season in New Jersey than women, younger voters, and those living in more developed parts of the state. In the western states, where there are large black populations, there are spring and year-round seasons. Approximately 18,845 black bears were killed annually in the USA between 1988\u20131992. Within this period, annual kills ranged from six bears in South Carolina to 2,232 in Maine.According to Dwight Schuh in his Bowhunter's Encyclopedia, black bears are the third most popular quarry of bowhunters, behind deer and elk.Schuh, Dwight R.

Black bears were the only bear species the Kutchin hunted for their meat, though this constituted only a small part of their diet.Nelson, Richard K. Hunters of the northern forest: designs for survival among the Alaskan Kutchin, University of Chicago Press, 1986, ISBN 0-226-57181-5 According to the second volume of Frank Forester's field sports of the United States, and British provinces, of North America: Theodore Roosevelt himself likened the flesh of young black bears to that of pork, and not as coarse or flavourless as the meat of grizzlies.Roosevelt, Theodore. Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Hunting Trips on the Prairie and in the Mountains, Adamant Media Corporation, ISBN 1-4212-6647-4 The most favoured cuts of the black bear's meat are concentrated in the legs and loins. Meat from the neck, front legs and shoulders is usually ground into minced meat or used for stews and casseroles. Keeping the fat tends to give the meat a strong flavour. As black bears can have trichinellosis, cooking temperatures need to be high in order to kill the parasites.Smith, Richard P.

The fat most favoured for this purpose was the hard white fat found in the body's interior. As only a small portion of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard. However animal rights activism over the last decade has slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from black bear has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics."}, {"description": "Build The skulls of American black bears are broad, with narrow muzzles and large jaw hinges. In Virginia, the total length of adult bear skulls was found to average 262 to. Across its range, greatest skull length for the species has been reportedly measured from 23.5 to. Females tend to have more slender and pointed faces than males. Their claws are typically black or grayish brown. The claws are short and rounded, being thick at the base and tapering to a point. Claws from both hind and front legs are almost identical in length, though the foreclaws tend to be more sharply curved. The paws of the species are relatively sizeable, with a rear foot length of 13.7 to, being proportionly larger than other medium-sized bear species but much smaller than the paws of large adult brown and especially polar bears. The soles of the feet are black or brownish, and are naked, leathery and deeply wrinkled. The hind legs are relatively longer than those of Asiatic black bears. The vestigal tail is usually 4.8\u00a0inches (12\u00a0cm) long. The ears are small and rounded, and are set well back on the head.Black bears are highly dexterous, being capable of opening screw-top jars and manipulating door latches. They also have great physical strength. Even bear cubs have been known to turn over flat-shaped rocks weighing 310 to by flipping them over with a single foreleg. They move in a rhythmic, sure-footed way and can run at speeds of 25\u201330\u00a0mph (40\u201350\u00a0km/h). Black bears have good eyesight, and have been proven experimentally to be able to learn visual discrimination tasks based on color faster than chimpanzees and as fast as dogs. They are also capable of rapidly learning to distinguish different shapes, such as small triangles, circles and squares. Size Black bear weight tends to vary according to age, sex, health, and season. Seasonal variation in weight is very pronounced: in autumn, their pre-den weight tends to be 30% higher than in spring, when black bears emerge from their dens. Black bears on the East Coast tend to be heavier on average than those on the West Coast, although black bears follow Bergmann's rule and bears from the northwest are often slightly heavier than the bears from the southeast.

Cuvier, 1823) Despite their name, black bears show a great deal of color variation. Individual coat colors can range from white, blond, cinnamon, or light brown to dark chocolate brown or to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Bluish tinged black bears occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia. White to cream colored black bears occur in coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of south-western British Columbia. Albino specimens have also been recorded. Black coats tend to predominate in moist areas such as New England, New York, Tennessee, Michigan and western Washington. Approximately 70% of all black bears are black, though only 50% of black bears in the Rocky Mountains are black. Many black bears in Northwestern North America are cinnamon, blond or light brown in color, and thus may sometimes be mistaken for grizzly bears. Grizzly (and other types of brown) bears can be distinguished by their shoulder hump, larger size and broader, more concave skull.Macdonald, D.W. (2006) The Encyclopedia of Mammals.

It is the only species classified in the genus Callimico, and the monkeys are sometimes referred to as \"callimicos\".Goeldi's marmosets are blackish or blackish-brown in color and the hair on their head and tail sometimes has red, white, or silverly brown highlights. Their bodies are about 8 \u2013 long, and their tails are about 10 \u2013 long. Goeldi's marmoset was first described in 1904, making Callimico one of the more recent monkey genera to be described. In older classification schemes it was sometimes placed in its own family Callimiconidae and sometimes along with the marmosets and tamarins in the subfamily Callitrichinae in the family Cebidae. More recently, Callitrichinae has been (re-)elevated to family status as Callitrichidae.Females reach sexual maturity at 8.5 months, males at 16.5 months. The gestation period lasts from 140 to 180 days. Unlike other New World monkeys, they have the capacity to give birth twice a year. The mother carries a single baby monkey per pregnancy, whereas most other species in the family Callitrichidae usually give birth to twins. For the first 2\u20133 weeks the mother acts as the primary caregiver until the father takes over most of the responsibilities except for nursing. The infant is weaned after about 65 days. Females outnumber males by 2 to 1.Dean Falk (2000), Primate Diversity, W.W. Norton and Company, ISBN 0-393-97428-6. The life expectancy in captivity is about 10 years.Goeldi's marmosets prefer to forage in dense scrubby undergrowth; perhaps because of this, they are rare, with groups living in separate patches of suitable habitat, separated by miles of unsuitable flora. In the wet season, their diet includes fruit, insects, spiders, lizards, frogs, and snakes. In the dry season, they feed on fungi, the only tropical primates known to depend on this source of food. They live in small social groups (approximately six individuals) that stay within a few feet of one another most of the time, staying in contact via high-pitched calls. They are also known to form polyspecific groups with tamarins, perhaps because Goeldi's Marmosets are not known to have the X-linked polymorphism which enables some individuals of other New World Monkey species to see in full tri-chromatic vision.The species takes its name from its discoverer, the Swiss naturalist Emil August Goeldi."}, {"description": "Springtamarin Der Springtamarin (Callimico goeldii) ist eine Primatenart aus der Familie der Krallenaffen.

This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old. Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake. On average, females produce two cubs in a litter and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the mother will not mate. Once the young leave or are killed, females may not produce another litter for three or more years, depending on environmental conditions. Male grizzly bears have large territories, up to 4000 km2, making finding a female scent difficult in such low population densities.Grizzlies are subject to population fragmentation, which tends to reduce the population by causing inbreeding depression. The gestation period for grizzly bears is approximately 180\u2013250 days.Litter size is between one and four cubs, averaging twins or triplets. Cubs are always born in the mother's winter den while she is in hibernation. Female grizzlies are fiercely protective of their cubs, being able to fend off predators as large as male bears bigger than they are in defense of the cubs. Cubs feed entirely on their mother's milk until summer comes, after which they still drink milk but begin to eat solid foods. Cubs gain weight rapidly during their time with the mother \u2014 their weight will have ballooned from 4.5 to in the two years spent with the mother.

In British Columbia, grizzly bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia when the European settlers arrived. However, population size has since significantly decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears. Population estimates for British Columbia are based on hair-snagging, DNA-based inventories, mark-recapture, and a refined multiple regression model.Hamilton, A. N. 2008 Grizzly Bear Population Estimate for British Columbia. Ministry of Environment, British Columbia. In 2003, researchers from the University of Alberta spotted a grizzly on Melville Island in the high Arctic, which is the most northerly sighting ever documented.The Alaskan population of 30,000 individuals is the highest population of any province/state in North America. Populations in Alaska are densest along the coast, where food supplies such as salmon are more abundant. The Admiralty Island National Monument protects the densest population \u2014 1,600 bears on a 1,600-square mile island.[1] Continental United States Only about 1,500 grizzlies are left in the lower 48 states of the US. Of these, about 800 live in Montana. About 600 more live in Wyoming, in the Yellowstone-Teton area. There are an estimated 70\u2013100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern Idaho. Its original range included much of the Great Plains and the southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.In September 2007, a hunter produced evidence of grizzly bears returning to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness ecosystem, on the central Idaho and western Montana border, by killing a male grizzly bear there. In northern Washington Grizzly bears have been sighted returning to the North Cascades ecosystem though the population there is estimated to be only 5\u201310 bears. There is the possibility that Grizzlies may begin repopulating in Colorado, although there has been no confirmed sighting of a grizzly in that state since 1979.Other provinces and the United States may use a combination of methods for population estimates. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in Mexico, European countries, some areas of Canada and in the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with competing predators and predation on cubs is another possible limiting factor for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from scavenged carcasses from predators as an easy food source when other food sources decline. There are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears total located throughout North America most of which reside in Alaska."}, {"description": "The grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the contiguous United States and endangered in parts of Canada. In May 2002, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba range) of grizzly bears as extirpated in Canada. As of 2002, grizzly bears were listed as Special Concern under the COSEWIC registry and considered threatened under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10\u201320 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, although there have been sightings.Knibb, David (2008) Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear, Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 164\u2013213, ISBN 978-1-59766-037-2. These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the international boundary.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims the Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk areas are linked through British Columbia, a claim that is disputed.Knibb, David (2008) Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear, Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 202\u2013204, ISBN 978-1-59766-037-2. U.S. and Canadian national parks, such as Banff National Park, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and Theodore Roosevelt National Park are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect the bears.On 9 January 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the list of threatened and protected species. In March 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \"de-listed\" the population, effectively removing Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies in the Yellowstone National Park area. Several environmental organizations, including the NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the federal government to relist the grizzly bear. On September 22, 2009, U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy reinstated protection due to the decline of whitebark pine tree, whose nuts are an important source of food for the bears. In 1996 the International Union for Conservation of Nature moved the grizzly bear to \"Lower Risk Least Concern\" status on the IUCN Red List.Farther north, in Alberta, Canada, intense DNA hair-snagging studies in 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than what it was formerly believed to be, and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development calculated a population of 841 bears. In 2002, the Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Alberta grizzly bear population be designated as threatened due to recent estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated the population was in decline. A recovery plan released by the provincial government in March 2008 indicated the grizzly population is lower than previously believed. In 2010, the provincial government formally listed its population of about 700 grizzlies as \"Threatened\".Alberta designates grizzly bears a threatened species. Alberta.ca (2010-06-03). Retrieved 5 August 2013.Environment Canada consider the grizzly bear to a \"special concern\" species, as it is particularly sensitive to human activities and natural threats. In Alberta and British Columbia, the species is considered to be at risk. In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears in the British Columbia population, which was lower than previously estimated due to refinements in the population model.The Mexican grizzly bear (Ursus arctos nelsoni) is extinct."}, {"description": "The grizzly bear is by nature a long-living animal. Females live longer than males due to their less dangerous life, avoiding the seasonal breeding fights males engage in. The average lifespan for a male is estimated at 22 years, with that of a female being slightly longer at 26. The oldest wild inland grizzly was 34 years old in Alaska; the oldest coastal bear was 39.Brown, Gary. The Great Bear Almanac. Guilford, CT, 1993, pg. 91. Captive grizzlies have lived as long as 44 years, but most grizzlies inevitably die in their first few years of life from predation or hunting."}, {"description": "With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, the gray wolf. The interactions of U. arctos horribilis with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by wolves. The grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent). While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.Black bears generally stay out of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.Busch, Robert H. (2000) The Grizzly Almanac. New York, p. 94. ISBN 1-58574-143-4.The segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears for the same resources. For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.The relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals. Cougars generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills.Hornocker, M., and S. Negri (Eds.). (2009). Cougar: ecology and conservation. University of Chicago Press. Chicago, IL, ISBN 0226353443. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.Coyotes, foxes, and wolverines are generally regarded as pests to the grizzlies rather than competition, though they may compete for smaller prey, such as ground squirrels and rabbits. All three will try to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more than normal scraps for the smaller animal. Packs of coyotes have also displaced grizzly bears in disputes over kills."}, {"description": "Trophy hunting causes an imbalance between the sexes, as hunters target primarily older males for their size. Older males' deaths allow other males to migrate in and claim the territory. Older male bears will have had cubs with female bears in the region. This may cause the newly migrated male bears to become infanticidal towards the late males' cubs.Grizzly bear hunting for the purpose of wildlife management is permitted in British Columbia, Canada. Approximately 1602 special hunting license \"tags\" were drawn for via lottery & sold throughout all of B.C. in 2012, by the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations (a provincial government department). The Canadian government website notes that killing female grizzly bears is detrimental to the re-population of the species, and encourages culling of males."}, {"description": "Grizzly bears hibernate for 5\u20137 months each year. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid March, while females emerge in April or early May.In preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately 180 kg, during a period of hyperphagia, before going into hibernation. The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above 1800 m on north-facing slopes. There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can \"partially\" recycle their body wastes during this period. Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether."}, {"description": "The grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are dispersed and excreted in a germinable condition. Some studies have shown germination success is indeed increased as a result of seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces. This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats.While foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems. An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land. Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment. An area that has been dug by the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed area.Nitrogen cycling is not only facilitated by grizzlies digging for food, it is also accomplished via their habit of carrying salmon carcasses into surrounding forests. It has been found that spruce tree (Picea glauca) foliage within 500 m of the stream where the salmon have been obtained contains nitrogen originating from salmon on which the bears preyed. These nitrogen influxes to the forest are directly related to the presence of grizzly bears and salmon.Grizzlies directly regulate prey populations and also help prevent overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species in the food chain. An experiment in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in the United States showed removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused populations of their herbivorous prey to increase. This, in turn, changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which decreased the population sizes of migratory birds. This provides evidence grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a major influence on the entire ecosystem they inhabit.When grizzly bears fish for salmon along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, brain and roe of the fish. In doing so, they provide a food source for gulls, ravens, and foxes, all or which eat salmon as well; this benefits both the bear and the smaller predators."}, {"description": "Although grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies are larger than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the richness of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses. None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, it is not uncommon to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing 1200 lb. Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies. Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws. At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots. Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them. During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.Inland grizzlies may eat fish too, most notably in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone cutthroat trout. The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique because it is the only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish. However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of the trout population and there is a slight chance that the trout will be eliminated.Meat, as already described, is an important part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as marmots, ground squirrels, lemmings, and voles. The most famous example of such predation is in Denali National Park and Preserve, where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up Arctic ground squirrels to eat. In some areas, grizzly bears prey on hoary marmots, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in hibernation.Whitaker, John O. (1980) The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals. Chanticleer Press, New York, p. 388. ISBN 0-394-50762-2. Larger prey includes bison and moose, which are sometimes taken by bears in Yellowstone National Park. Because bison and moose are dangerous prey, grizzlies usually use cover to stalk them and/or pick off weak individuals or calves. Grizzlies in Alaska also regularly prey on moose calves, which in Denali National Park may be their main source of meat. In fact, grizzly bears are such important predators of moose and elk calves in Alaska and in Yellowstone, that they may kill as many as 51 percent of elk or moose calves born that year. Grizzly bears have also been blamed in the decline of elk in Yellowstone National Park when the actual predators were thought to be gray wolves. In northern Alaska, grizzlies are a significant predator of caribou, mostly taking sick or old individuals or calves. Several studies show that grizzly bears may follow the caribou herds year-round in order to maintain their food supply. In northern Alaska, grizzly bears often encounter muskox. Despite the fact that muskox do not usually occur in grizzly habitat and that they are bigger and more powerful than caribou, predation on muskox by grizzlies has been recorded.Grizzly bears along the Alaskan coast also scavenge on dead or washed up whales. Usually such incidents involve only one or two grizzlies at a carcass, but up to ten large males have been seen at a time eating a dead humpback whale. Dead seals and sea lions are also consumed.Although the diets of grizzly bears vary extensively based on seasonal and regional changes, plants make up a large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80\u201390%. Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include blueberries, blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), buffalo berries (Shepherdia argentea), soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis), and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on miller moths that congregate on mountain slopes. When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right after an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in massive amounts. When food sources become scarcer, however, they separate once again."}, {"description": "Conservation efforts have become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades, as population numbers have dramatically declined. Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary located along the north coast of British Columbia; at 44,300 ha in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area. When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.The Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on Grouse Mountain in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001. The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.Another factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered. In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of \"park forest\" to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads. Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem. To date, most corridors are found to be infrequently used, and thus genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes through genetic drift. Current data suggest female grizzly bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of offspring."}, {"description": "Grizzlies are considered by some experts to be more aggressive than black bears when defending themselves and their offspring. Aggressive behavior in grizzly bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies are too large to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female grizzlies in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age. Mothers defending their cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of fatal injuries to humans.How Dangerous are Black Bears. Bear.org. Retrieved 17 August 2012. Grizzly bears normally avoid contact with people. In spite of their obvious physical advantages and many opportunities, they almost never view humans as prey; bears rarely actively hunt humans.Ministry of Environment. 2002. Grizzly Bears in British Columbia. Retrieved 12 October 2009. Most grizzly bear attacks result from a bear that has been surprised at very close range, especially if it has a supply of food to protect, or female grizzlies protecting their offspring. In such situations, property may be damaged and the bear may physically harm the person.Exacerbating this is the fact that intensive human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears. An example of this spatiotemporal intersection occurs during the fall season: grizzly bears congregate near streams to feed on salmon when anglers are also intensively using the river.Increased human\u2013bear interaction has created \"problem bears\", which are bears that have become adapted to human activities or habitat.Austin, M.

Aversive conditioning, a method involving using deterrents such as rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals, or acoustic deterrent devices to teach bears to associate humans with negative experiences, is ineffectual when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with food. Such bears are translocated or killed because they pose a threat to humans. The B.C. government kills approximately 50 problem bears each year and overall spends more than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate bears and kill them.For back-country campers, hanging food between trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food is to use a bear canister.Traveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance of bear-related injuries while hiking in bear country.Grizzly bears are especially dangerous because of the strength of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It has been estimated that a bite from a grizzly could crush a bowling ball.Facts: Casey & Brutus: Grizzly Encounters \u2013 National Geographic Channel \u2013 UK. Natgeotv.com (2010-04-20).

This is not to be confused with the word \"grisly\". Nonetheless, after careful study, naturalist George Ord formally classified the California grizzly in 1815\u2014not for its hair, but for its character\u2014as Ursus horribilis. Thus Ord made a famous pun. Indeed there were many accounts of grizzlies fighting and beating longhorn bulls. Evolution and geneticsThe ancestors of the grizzly bear subspecies were brown bears originating in Eurasia that traveled to North America approximately 50,000 years ago. This is a very recent event, on an evolutionary timescale, causing the North American grizzly bear to be very similar to brown bears inhabiting Siberia and northeast Asia. The closest Eurasian subspecies to the grizzly bears are believed to be the Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus) for mainland grizzlies and the Kamchatka brown bear (U. a. beringianus) for the coastal Alaskan and Kodiak bears which arrived in North America shortly before the Bering land bridge flooded.When it received its scientific name in 1815, the grizzly was classified as a separate species from all other bears. However, modern genetic testing reveals the grizzly to be a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). So in Eurasia, it is the \"brown bear\"; in North America, it is the \"grizzly\".In other words, the grizzly and the brown bear are one species on two continents. Currently, Rausch and others classify three subspecies of the new \"North American brown bear\": U. a. horribilis, middendorffi, and gyas. But more recent studies of mtDNA suggest that this three-fold division of living grizzlies needs revision. Further testing of Y-chromosomes is required to yield an accurate new taxonomy with different subspecies.Coastal grizzlies, often referred to by the popular but geographically redundant synonym of \"brown bear\" or \"Alaskan brown bear\" are larger and darker than inland grizzlies, which is why they, too, were considered a different species from grizzlies. Kodiak grizzly bears were also at one time considered distinct. Thus, at one time there were five different \"species\" of brown bear, including three in North America.Grizz: Of Men and the Great Bear. National Geographic Article, February 1986. Douglas H.

Some of the best bear viewing in the world occurs on coastal areas of the Alaska Peninsula, including in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge. Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides. Katmai National Park and Preserve is one of the best spots to view brown bears. The bear population in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2100. The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about 300 mi southwest of the city of Anchorage. At Brooks Camp, a famous site exists where grizzlies can be seen catching salmon from atop a platform\u2014you can even view this online from a cam. In coastal areas of the park, such as Hallo Bay, Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon, American Creek, Big River, Kamishak River, Savonoski River, Moraine Creek, Funnel Creek, Battle Creek, Nantuk Creek, Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay you can often watch bears fishing alongside wolves, eagles, and river otters. Coastal areas host the highest population densities year round because there is a larger viariety of food sources available, but Brooks Camp hosts the highest population (100 bears).The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge, on the McNeil River, is home to the greatest concentration of brown bears in the world. An estimated 144 individual bears have been identified at the falls in a single summer with as many as 74 at one time; 60 or more bears at the falls is a frequent sight, and it is not uncommon to see 100 bears at the falls throughout a single day. The McNeil River State Game Refuge, containing Chenik Lake and a smaller number of grizzly bears, has been closed to grizzly hunting since 1995. All of the Katmai-McNeil area is closed to hunting except for Katmai National Preserve, where regulated legal hunting takes place. In all, the Katmai-McNeil area has an estimated 2500 grizzly bears.Admiralty Island, in southeast Alaska, was known to early natives as Xootsnoow\u00fa, meaning \"fortress of bears,\" and is home to the densest grizzly population in North America. An estimated 1600 grizzlies live on the island, which itself is only 90 mi long. The best place to view grizzly bears in the island is probably Pack Creek, in the Stan Price State Wildlife Sanctuary. 20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform. Kodiak Island, hence its name, is another good place to view bears. An estimated 3500 Kodiak grizzly bears inhabit the island, 2300 of these in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.

It is an omnivore and eats underground fruiting bodies of fungi, roots, fruit, flowers, seeds and insects and their larvae.Bennett 1989 Fungi is the main dietary component, and are very important resource in their diet with at least 50 species consumed depending on seasonal variation.Lewis 2009 During the fall and winter months potoroos primarily consume fungi and seeds and in the spring and summer months the amount of arthropods, plant tissue, fruits, and flowers consumed increase.Because it eats fungi, it spreads fungal spores in its droppings.

It is likely that the species has always been confined to Afroalpine habitats, and was thus never widespread. In historical times, all of the Ethiopian wolf's threats are both directly and indirectly human-induced, as the wolf's highland habitat, with its high annual rainfall and rich fertile soils, is ideal for agricultural activities. Its proximate threats include habitat loss and fragmentation (subsistence agriculture, overgrazing, road construction and livestock farming), diseases (primarily rabies and CDV), conflict with humans (poisoning, persecution and road kills), and hybridisation with dogs. DiseaseRabies outbreaks, stemming from infected dogs, have killed many Ethiopian wolves over the 1990s and 2000s. Two well documented outbreaks in Bale, one in 1991 and another in 2008-2009, resulted in the die-off or disappearance of 75% of known animals. Both incidents prompted reactive vaccinations in 2003 and 2008-2009 respectively. CDV is not necessarily fatal to wolves, though there has been a recent increase in infection, with outbreaks of canine distemper having been detected in 2005-2006 in Bale and in 2010 across subpopulations. Habitat lossDuring the 1990s, wolf populations in Gosh Meda and Guguftu went extinct. In both cases, the extent of Afroalpine habitat above the limit of agriculture had been reduced to less than 20\u00a0km\u00b2. The EWCP team confirmed the extinction of a wolf population in Mt. Guna in 2011, whose numbers had been in single figures for several years. Habitat loss in the Ethiopian highlands is directly linked to agricultural expansion into Afroalpine areas. In the northern highlands, human density is the among the highest in Africa, with 300 people per km\u00b2 in some localities, with almost all areas below 3,700m having been converted into barley fields. Suitable areas of land below this limit are under some level of protection, such as Guassa-Menz and the Denkoro Reserve, or within the southern highlands, such as the Arsi and Bale Mountains. The most vulnerable wolf populations to habitat loss are those within relatively low-lying Afroalpine ranges, such as those in Aboi Gara and Delanta in North Wollo. Population fragmentationSome Ethiopian wolf populations, particularly those in North Wollo, show signs of high fragmentation, which is likely to increase with current rates of human expansion. The dangers posed by fragmentation include increased contact with humans, dogs and livestock, and further risk of isolation and inbreeding in wolf populations. Although there is no evidence of inbreeding depression or reduced fitness, the extremely small wolf population sizes, particularly those north of the Rift Valley, raises concerns among conservationists. Elsewhere, the Bale populations are fairly continuous, while those in Simien can still interbreed through habitat corridors. Encroachment within protected areasIn the Simien Mountains National Park, human and livestock populations are increasing by 2% annually, with further road construction allowing easy access to peasants into wolf home ranges. 3,171 people in 582 households were found to be living in the park and 1,477 outside the park in October 2005. Although the area of the park has since been expanded, further settlement stopped and grazing restricted, effective enforcement may take years. As of 2011, there are about 30,000 people in 30 villages around the park and two within it, including 4,650 cereal farmers, herders, woodcutters and many others. In Bale there are numerous villages in and around the area, comprising over 8,500 households with more than 12,500 dogs. It was estimated in 2007 that the number of households within wolf habitat numbered 1,756. Because of the high number of dogs, the risk of infection in local wolf populations is high. Furthermore, intentional and unintentional brush fires are frequent in the ericaceous moorlands wolves inhabit. Overgrazing Although wolves in Bale have learned to use cattle to conceal their presence when hunting for rodents, the level of grazing in the area can adversely affect the vegetation available for the wolves' prey. Although no declines in wolf populations related to overgrazing have occurred, it is known that high grazing intensities can lead to soil erosion and vegetation deterioration in Afroalpine areas such as Delanta and Simien. Human persecution and disturbanceDirect killings of wolves were more frequent during the Ethiopian Civil War, when firearms were more available. The extinction of wolves in Mt. Choqa was likely due to persecution. Although people living close to wolves in modern times believe that wolf populations are recovering, negative attitudes towards the species persist due to livestock predation. Wolves were largely unmolested by humans in Bale, as they were not considered threats to sheep and goats. However, they are perceived as threats to livestock elsewhere, with cases of retaliatory killings occurring in the Arsi Mountains. The Ethiopian wolf has not been recorded to be exploited for its fur, though there was one case where wolf hides were used as saddle pads. It was once hunted by sportsmen, though this is now illegal. Vehicle collisions killed at least four wolves in the Sanetti Plateau since 1988, while two others were left with permanent limps. Similar accidents are a risk in areas where roads cut across wolf habitats, such as in Menz and Arsi. Hybridisation with dogsIncidences of Ethiopian wolf-dog hybridisation have been recorded in Bale's Web Valley. At least four hybrids were identified and sterilised in the area. Although hybridisation has not been detected elsewhere, it could pose a threat to the wolf population's genetic integrity, resulting in outbreeding depression or a reduction in fitness, though this does not appear to have taken place."}, {"description": "The earliest fossil carnivores that can be linked with some certainty to canids are the Eocene Miacids, which lived some 38 to 56 million years ago. The Miacids later diverged into caniforms and feliforms, with the former line leading to such genera as the coyote-sized Mesocyon of the Oligocene (38 to 24 million years ago), the fox-like Leptocyon and the wolf-like Tomarctus which inhabited North America some 10 million years ago. Although there are fossil records of wolf-like canids from Late Pleistocene Eurasia, there are no fossil records for the Ethiopian wolf itself. The species may have evolved from a wolf-like ancestor crossing into North Africa from Eurasia as early as 100,000 years ago. Due to the high density of rodents in their new Afroalpine habitat, the ancestors of the Ethiopian wolf gradually developed into specialised rodent hunters. This specialisation is reflected in the animal's skull morphology, with its very elongated head, long jaw and widely spaced teeth. It was during this period that the species likely attained its highest abundance, and had a relatively continuous distribution. This changed approximately 15,000 years ago with the onset of the current interglacial, which caused the species' Afroalpine habitat to fragment, thus isolating Ethiopian wolf populations from each other.Gottelli D, Marino J, Sillero-Zubiri C, Funk S (2004). The effect of the last glacial age on speciation and population genetic structure of the endangered Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis). Molecular Ecology 13:2275-2286.The Ethiopian wolf is one of five Canis species present in Africa, and is readily distinguishable from jackals by its larger size, relatively longer legs, distinct reddish coat and white markings. John Edward Gray and Glover Morrill Allen originally classified the species under a separate genus, Simenia, and Oscar Neumann considered it to be \"only an exaggerated fox\". Juliet Clutton-Brock refuted the separate genus in favour of placing the species in the genus Canis, upon noting cranial similarities with the side-striped jackal.Clutton-Brock, J., Corbet, G.G., and Hills, M. (1976). \"A review of the family Canidae, with a classification by numerical methods.\" Bull. Brit. Mus. Nat. Hist. 29, 119\u2013199.Initial molecular evidence suggested that the Ethiopian wolf is a descendant of the grey wolf, though more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case; although the Ethiopian wolf is closely related to grey wolves, coyotes and golden jackals, it probably diverged some 3-4 million years ago.

The teeth, particularly the premolars, are small and widely spaced. The canine teeth measure 14\u201322\u00a0mm in length, while the carnassials are relatively small.

Its overall colour is ochre to rusty red, with dense whitish to pale ginger underfur. The fur of the throat, chest and underparts is white, with a distinct white band occurring around the sides of the neck. There is a sharp boundary between the red coat and white marks. The ears are thickly furred on the edges, though naked on the inside. The naked borders of the lips, the gums and palate are black. The lips, a small spot on the cheeks and an ascending crescent below the eyes are white. The thickly furred tail is white underneath, and has a black tip, though, unlike most other canids, there is no dark patch marking the supracaudal gland. It moults during the wet season (August\u2013October), and there is no evident seasonal variation in coat colour, though the contrast between the red coat and white markings increases with age and social rank. Females tend to have paler coats than males.

Ethiopes eos vocant theas. Ethiopia produces wolves with manes, so diversely coloured, men say, that no hue is lacking. A characteristic of Ethiopian wolves is that they leap so high that they seem to have wings, going further than they would by running. They never attack men, however. In winter, they grow long hair; in summer, they are hairless. The Ethiopians call them theas. The species was first scientifically described in 1835 by Eduard R\u00fcppell, who provided a skull for the British Museum. European writers traveling in Ethiopia during the mid-19th century (then called Abyssinia) wrote that the animal's skin was never worn by natives, as it was popularly believed that the wearer would die should any wolf hairs enter an open wound,Parkyns, Mansfield (1853). Life in Abyssinia: Being Notes Collected During Three Years' Residence and Travels in that Country. Vol. II. John Murray. pp. 12-13. while Charles Darwin hypothesised that the species gave rise to greyhounds.Darwin, Charles (1868). The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication. Vol. I. Orange Judd. p. 48. Since then, it was scarcely heard of in Europe up until the early 20th century, when several skins were shipped to England by Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton during his travels in Abyssinia.The Ethiopian wolf was recognised as requiring protection in 1938, and received it in 1974. The first in-depth studies on the species occurred in the 1980s, with the onset of the American sponsored Bale Mountains Research Project. Ethiopian wolf populations in the Bale Mountains National Park were negatively affected by the political unrest of the Ethiopian Civil War, though the critical state of the species was revealed during the early 1990s after a combination of shooting and a severe rabies epidemic decimated most packs studied in the Web Valley and Sanetti Plateau. In response, the IUCN reclassified the species from Endangered to Critically Endangered in 1994. The IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group advocated a three front strategy of education, wolf population monitoring, and rabies control in domestic dogs. The establishment of the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme in Bale soon followed in 1995 by Oxford University, in conjunction with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA).Soon after, a further wolf population was discovered in the Central Highlands. Elsewhere, information on Ethiopian wolves remained scarce; although first described in 1835 as living in the Simien Mountains, the paucity of information stemming from that area indicated that the species was likely declining there, while reports from the Gojjam plateau were a century out of date. Wolves were recorded in the Arsi Mountains since the early 20th century, and in the Bale Mountains in the late 1950s. The status of the Ethiopian wolf was re-assessed in the late 1990s, following improvements in travel conditions into northern Ethiopia. The surveys taken revealed local extinctions in Mount Choqa, Gojjam, and in every northern Afroalpine region where agriculture is well developed and human pressure acute. This revelation stressed the importance of the Bale Mountains wolf populations for the species' long-term survival, as well as the need to protect other surviving populations. A decade after the rabies outbreak, the Bale populations had fully recovered to pre-epizootic levels, prompting the species' downlisting to Endangered in 2004, though it still remains the world's rarest canid, and Africa's most endangered carnivore."}, {"description": "Habitat The Ethiopian wolf is restricted to isolated pockets of Afroalpine grasslands and heathlands inhabited by Afroalpine rodents. Its ideal habitat extends from above the tree line at about 3,200m to 4,500m, with some wolves inhabiting the Bale Mountains being present in montane grasslands at 3,000m. Although specimens were collected in Gojjam and northwestern Shoa at 2,500m in the early 20th century, there are no recent records of the species occurring below 3,000m. In modern times, subsistence agriculture, which extends up to 3,700m, has largely restricted the species to the highest peaks. The Ethiopian wolf utilises all Afroalpine habitats, but has a preference for open areas containing short herbaceous and grassland communities inhabited by rodents, which are most abundant along flat or gently sloping areas with poor drainage and deep soils. Prime wolf habitat in the Bale Mountains consists of short Alchemilla herbs and grasses, with low vegetation cover. Other favourable habitats consist of tussock grasslands, high altitude scrubs rich in Helichrysum, and short grasslands growing in shallow soils. In its northern range, the wolf's habitat is composed of plant communities characterised by a matrix of Festuca tussocks, Euryops bushes and giant lobelias, all of which are favoured by the wolf's rodent prey. Although marginal in importance, the ericaceous moorlands at 3,200-3,600m in Simien may provide a refuge for wolves in highly disturbed areas. DietIn the Bale Mountains, the Ethiopian wolf's primary prey are big-headed mole-rats, though it will also feed on grass rats, black-clawed brush-furred rats and highland hares. Other secondary prey species include vlei rats, yellow-spotted brush-furred rats, and occasionally goslings and eggs. Ethiopian wolves have twice been observed to feed on rock hyraxes and mountain nyala calves. In areas where the big-headed mole-rat is absent, the smaller East African mole-rat is targeted. In the Simien Mountains, the Ethiopian wolf preys on Abyssinian grass rats. Undigested sedge leaves have occasionally been found in Ethiopian wolf stomachs. It is possible that sedge is ingested for roughage or for parasite control. The species may scavenge on carcasses, but is usually displaced by dogs and golden jackals. It typically poses no threat to livestock, with farmers often leaving herds in wolf inhabited areas unattended."}, {"description": "The Ethiopian wolf is not listed on the CITES Appendices, though it is afforded full official protection under Ethiopia's Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI, with the killing of a wolf carrying a two year jail sentence.The species is present in several protected areas, including three areas in South Wollo (Bale Mountains National Park, Simien Mountains National Park and Borena Saiynt Regional Park), one in north Shoa (Guassa Community Conservation Area) and one in the Arsi Mountains Regional Park. Areas of suitable wolf habitat have recently increased to 87%, as a result of boundary extensions in Simien and the creation of the Arsi Mountains Regional Park.Steps taken to insure the survival of the Ethiopian wolf include dog vaccination campaigns in Bale, Menz and Simien, sterilization programs for wolf-dog hybrids in Bale, rabies vaccination of wolves in parts of Bale, community and school education programs in Bale and Wollo, contributing to the running of national parks, and population monitoring and surveying. A 10-year National Action Plan was formed in February 2011.The species' critical situation was first publicised by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1983, with the Bale Mountains Research Project being established shortly after. This was followed by a detailed four-year field study, which prompted the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group to produce an action plan in 1997. The plan called for the education of people in wolf-inhabited areas, wolf population monitoring and the stemming of rabies in dog populations. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme was formed in 1995 by Oxford University, with donours including the Born Free Foundation, Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) and the Wildlife Conservation Network.The overall aim of the EWCP is to protect the wolf's Afroalpine habitat in Bale, and establish additional conservation areas in Menz and Wollo. As well as monitoring wolves in Bale, south and north Wollo, the EWCP carries out education campaigns for people outside the wolf's range in order to improve dog husbandry and manage diseases within and around the park. The program seeks to vaccinate up to 5,000 dogs a year in order to reduce rabies and CDV in wolf inhabited areas."}, {"description": "Social and territorial behavioursThe Ethiopian wolf is a social animal, which lives in family groups containing up to 20 individuals older than one year, though packs of six wolves are more common. Packs are formed by dispersing males and a few females which, with the exception of the breeding female, are reproductively suppressed. Each pack has a well established hierarchy, with dominance and subordination displays being common. Upon dying, a breeding female can be replaced by a resident daughter, though this increases the risk of inbreeding. Such a risk is sometimes circumvented by multiple paternity and extra-pack matings. The dispersal of wolves from their packs is largely restricted by the scarcity of unoccupied habitat.These packs live in communal territories, which encompass 6 km2 of land on average. In areas with little food, the species lives in pairs, sometimes accompanied by pups, and defends larger territories averaging 13.4 km2. In the absence of disease, Ethiopian wolf territories are largely stable, but packs can expand whenever the opportunity arises, such as when another pack disappears. The size of each territory correlates with the abundance of rodents, the number of wolves in a pack, and the survival of pups. Ethiopian wolves rest together in the open at night, and congregate for greetings and border patrols at dawn, noon and evenings. They may shelter from rain under overhanging rocks and behind boulders. The species never sleeps in dens, and only uses them for nursing pups. When patrolling their territories, Ethiopian wolves regularly scent-mark, and interact aggressively and vocally with other packs. Such confrontations typically end with the retreat of the smaller group. Reproduction and developmentThe mating season usually takes place in between August\u2013November. Courtship involves the breeding male following the female closely. The breeding female only accepts the advances of the breeding male, or males from other packs. The gestation period lasts 60\u201362 days, with pups being born between October\u2013December. Pups are born toothless and with their eyes closed, and are covered in a charcoal grey coat with a buff patch on the chest and abdomen. Litters consist of 2-6 pups, which emerge from their den after three weeks, at which time the dark coat is gradually replaced with the adult colouration. By the age of five weeks, the pups feed on a combination of milk and solid food, and become completely weaned off milk at the age of 10 weeks to six months. All members of the pack contribute to protecting and feeding the pups, with subordinate females sometimes assisting the dominant female by suckling them. Full growth and sexual maturity are attained at the age of two years. Hunting behaviours Unlike most social carnivores, the Ethiopian wolf tends to forage and feed on small prey alone. It is most active during the day, the time when rodents are themselves most active, though they have been observed to hunt in groups when targeting mountain nyala calves. Major Percy-Cotton described the hunting behaviour of Ethiopian wolves as thus: The technique described above is commonly used in hunting big-headed mole-rats, with the level of effort varying from scratching lightly at the hole to totally destroying a set of burrows, leaving metre high earth mounds. Wolves in Bale have been observed to forage among cattle herds, a tactic thought to aid in ambushing rodents out of their holes by using the cattle to hide their presence."}, {"description": "The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) is a canid native to the Ethiopian Highlands.

Mammalian Species 385: 1-6. Unlike most large canids, which are widespread, generalist feeders, the Ethiopian wolf is a highly specialised feeder of Afroalpine rodents with very specific habitat requirements. It is one of the world's rarest canids, and Africa's most endangered carnivore.The species' current range is limited to seven isolated mountain ranges at altitudes of 3,000\u20134,500m, with the overall adult population estimated at 360-440 individuals in 2011, more than half of them in the Bale Mountains.The Ethiopian wolf is listed as Endangered by the IUCN, on account of its small numbers and fragmented range. Threats include increasing pressure from expanding human populations, resulting in habitat degradation through overgrazing and disease transference from free ranging dogs. Its conservation is headed by Oxford University's Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP), which seeks to protect wolves through vaccination and community outreach programs."}]}

This is due to various physiological and behavioral characteristics. First, this marsupial is nocturnal and functions within a 24-hour circadian rhythm. During the nighttime it is protected from high temperatures that cause energy loss. While awake, it spends the majority of its time feeding. Every night it consumes approximately its own body weight of food. During periods of food shortage it decreases its duration of activity while also increasing its intensity of feeding. It uses specialized, sharp teeth to grind its prey into fine pieces. This increases its ability to obtain nutrients from its prey. It has a high rate of digestion and can use fat stored in its tail as an energy source.Another survival technique that it uses is daily torpor. It lowers its body temperature and metabolic rate, in order to reduce energy expenditure. Torpor is unaffected by alterations in photoperiod but is greatly affected by environmental conditions. Two conditions must occur in order for the fat-tailed dunnart to use daily torpor: low ambient temperatures and food shortage. There are seasonal variations in torpidity. They use it more often in the winter because food is scarce and it requires more energy to maintain a high constant body temperature. During torpor, the body temperature can drop as low as 14.6\u00a0\u00b0C. This species does not use torpor for extended periods of time, thus the heart rate is variable and does not reach a steady state, such as seen in long-term torpidators. This species is unique in that it can use torpor during development and reproduction. Even during lactation a female is capable of entering daily torpor without affecting the offspring.Coupled with the daily torpor is a process called re-warming. The re-warming process demands a high amount of energy in order to raise the body temperature. After awaking from a torpid state, these marsupials actively seek out areas in which they can bask in the sun to aid in this process.Nesting is also used as a behavioral survival technique. During times of cold temperatures, the fat-tailed dunnart shares nests with rodent species such as the household mouse, Mus musculus, to conserve heat. This is unusual because the fat-tailed dunnart preys upon these mice during less extreme conditions. Group nesting is observed only during times of non-breeding."}, {"description": "This species breeds from July to February, with the young in the pouch from July to April (Morton 1978b).

Home ranges in the Serengheti have been recorded to be 44 km2-72 km2, while one in the Negev desert was calculated at 61 km2. When marking their territory, striped hyenas use the paste of their anal pouch (hyena butter) to scent mark grass, stalks, stones, tree trunks and other objects. In aggressive encounters, the black patch near the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is erected. When fighting, striped hyenas will bite at the throat and legs, but avoid the mane, which serves as a signalling device. When greeting each other, they lick the mid-back region, sniff each other's noses, extrude their anal pouch or paw each other's throats. The species is not as vocal as the spotted hyena, its vocalisations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling. Reproduction and developmentThe striped hyena is monogamous, with the male helping the female to establish a den, raise young and feed her when cubs are born. The mating season varies according to location; in Transcaucasia, hyenas breed in January\u2013February, while those in southeast Turkmenia breed in October\u2013November. In captivity, breeding is non-seasonal. Mating can occur at any time of the day, during which the male grips the skin of the female's neck.The gestation period lasts 90\u201391 days. Striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings, closed eyes and small ears. This is in marked contrast to newborn spotted hyena cubs which are born almost fully developed, though with black, unmarked coats. Their eyes open after 7\u20138 days, and leave their dens after one month. Cubs are weaned at the age of 2 months, and are then fed by both parents. Despite the males' assistance, female hyenas are very protective of their cubs, and will chase their mates away from the cubs if they approach too closely. By autumn, the cubs are half the size of their parents. In the wild, striped hyenas can live for 12 years, while in captivity they have been known to reach 23. Burrowing behavioursThe striped hyena may dig its own dens, but it also establishes its lairs in caves, rock fissures, erosion channels and burrows formerly occupied by porcupines, wolves, warthogs and aardvarks. Hyena dens can be identified by the presence of bones at their entrances. The striped hyena hides in caves, niches, pits, dense thickets, reeds and plume grass during the day to shelter from predators, heat or winter cold. The size and elaboration of striped hyena dens varies according to location ; dens in the Karakum have entrances 0.67\u20130.72 m wide and are extended over a distance of 4.15\u20135 m, with no lateral extensions or special chambers. In contrast, hyena dens in Israel are much more elaborate and large, exceeding 27 m in length. Diet The striped hyena is primarily a scavenger which feeds mainly on ungulate carcasses in different stages of decomposition, fresh bones, cartilages, ligaments and bone marrow. It crushes long bones into fine particles and swallows them, though sometimes entire bones are eaten whole. The striped hyena is not a fussy eater, though it has an aversion to vulture flesh. It will occasionally attack and kill any animal it can overcome. It hunts prey by running it down, grabbing its flanks or groin and inflicting mortal wounds by tearing out the viscera. In Turkmenistan, the species is recorded to feed on wild boar, kulan, porcupines and tortoises. A seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits is an important food source in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, while in the Caucasuses, it is grasshoppers. In Israel, the striped hyena feeds on garbage, carrion and fruits. In eastern Jordan, its main sources of food are feral horse and water buffalo carcasses and village refuse. It has been suggested that only the large hyenas of the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia and the Indian subcontinent attack large prey, with no evidence of their smaller Arabian and east African cousins doing so. Because of its scavenging diet, the striped hyena requires more water to survive than most other carnivores. When eating, the striped hyena gorges itself until satisfied, though hyenas with cubs will transport food to their dens. Because of the high content of calcium in its diet, the faeces of the striped hyena becomes white very rapidly, and can be visible from long distances. Relationships with other predators The striped hyena competes with the gray wolf in the Middle East and central Asia. In the latter area, a great portion of the hyena's diet stems from wolf-killed carcasses. The striped hyena is dominant over the wolf on a one to one basis, though wolves in packs can displace single hyenas from carcasses. Both species have been known to share dens on occasion.Johnson, Daniel (1827) Sketches of Indian Field Sports: With Observations on the Animals; Also an Account of Some of the Customs of the Inhabitants; with a Description of the Art of Catching Serpents, as Practised by the Conjoors and Their Method of Curing Themselves when Bitten: with Remarks on Hydrophobia and Rabid Animals p. 45-46, R. Jennings, 1827 Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh which is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed.Macdonald, David (1987) Running with the Fox, p.77-79, Guild Publishing, London, ISBN 0-8160-1886-3The species frequently scavenges from the kills of felids such as tigers, leopards, cheetahs and caracals. A caracal can drive a subadult hyena from a carcass. The hyena usually wins in one-to-one disputes over carcasses with leopards, cheetahs and tiger cubs, but is dominated by adult tigers."}, {"description": "The species may have evolved from H. namaquensis of Pliocene Africa. Striped hyena fossils are common in Africa, with records going back as far as the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the Mediterranean region, it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of spotted hyenas in Asia at the end of the Ice Age. The striped hyena occurred for some time in Europe during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in France and Germany. It also occurred in Montmaurin, Hollabrunn in Austria, the Furninha Cave in Portugal and the Genista Caves in Gibraltar. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the brown hyena."}, {"description": "Build The striped hyena has a fairly massive, but short torso set on long legs. The hind legs are significantly shorter than the forelimbs, thus causing the back to slope downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the carpal region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region. The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws. The tail is short and the terminal hairs do not descend below the calcaneal tendon. The striped hyena lacks the enlarged clitoris and false scrotal sack noted in the female genitalia of the spotted hyena. The female has 3 pairs of teats. Adult weight can range from 22 to, averaging at about 35 kg. Body length can range from 85 to, not counting a tail of 25 to, and shoulder height is between 60 -.Mammals: Striped Hyena.

Myths and Facts about Hyenas. thisweekinpalestine.com #118 The male has a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands open into it from above the anus. Several sebaceous glands are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them. The anus can be everted up to a length of 5\u00a0cm, and is everted during social interaction and mating. When attacked, the striped hyena everts its rectum and sprays a pungent smelling liquid from its anal glands. Its eyesight is acute, though its senses of smell and hearing are weak.The skull is entirely typical of the genus, having a very high sagittal crest, a shortened facial region and an inflated frontal bone. The skull of the striped hyena differs from that of the brown and spotted hyena by its smaller size and slightly less massive build. It is nonetheless still powerfully structured and well adapted to anchoring exceptionally strong jaw muscles which give it enough bite-force to splinter a camel's thigh bone. Although the dentition is overall smaller than that of the spotted hyena, the upper molar of the striped hyena is far larger. The dental formula is: FurThe winter coat is unusually long and uniform for an animal its size, with a luxuriant mane of tough, long hairs along the back from the occiput to the base of the tail. The coat is generally coarse and bristly, though this varies according to season. In winter, the coat is fairly dense, soft, and has well-developed underfur. The guard hairs are 50\u201375\u00a0mm long on the flanks, 150\u2013225\u00a0mm long on the mane and 150\u00a0mm on the tail. In summer, the coat is much shorter and coarser, and lacks underfur, though the mane remains large.In winter, the coat is usually of a dirty-brownish grey or dirty gray colour. The hairs of the mane are light grey or white at the base, and black or dark brown at the tips. The muzzle is dark, greyish brown, brownish-grey or black, while the top of the head and cheeks are more lightly coloured. The ears are almost black. A large black spot is present on the front of the neck, and is separated from the chin by a light zone. A dark field ascends from the flanks ascending to the rear of the cheeks. The inner and outer surface of the forelegs are covered with small dark spots and transverse stripes. The flanks have four indistinct dark vertical stripes and rows of diffused spots. The outer surface of the thighs has 3\u20134 distinct vertical or oblique dark bands which merge into transverse stripes in the lower portion of the legs. The tip of the tail is black with white underfur. Geographic variation, no subspecies are recognised. The striped hyena is nonetheless a geographically varied animal. Hyenas in the Arabian peninsula have an accentuated blackish dorsal mane, with mid-dorsal hairs reaching 20\u00a0cm in length. The base colour of Arabian hyenas is grey to whitish grey, with dusky grey muzzles and buff yellow below the eyes. Hyenas in Israel have a dorsal crest which is mixed grey and black in colour, rather than being predominantly black. The largest striped hyenas come from the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, while those of east Africa and the Arabian peninsula are smaller."}, {"description": "The striped hyena's historical range encompasses Africa north of and including the Sahel zone, eastern Africa south into Tanzania, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East up to the Mediterranean shores, Turkey, Iraq, the Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia), Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan (excluding the higher areas of Hindukush) and the Indian Subcontinent. Today the species' distribution is patchy in most ranges, thus indicating that it occurs in many isolated populations, particularly in most of west Africa, most of the Sahara, parts of the Middle East, the Caucasus and central Asia. It does however have a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Its modern distribution in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan is unknown with some sizable large number in India in open areas of Deccan Peninsula.

Abi-Said (2006) Reviled as a grave robber: The ecology and conservation of striped hyaenas in the human dominated landscapes of Lebanon Ph.D. thesis, University of Kent (Biodiversity management) In the Near and Middle East, striped hyenas are generally regarded as physical incarnations of jinns.Frembgen, J\u00fcrgen W. The Magicality of the Hyena: Beliefs and Practices in West and South Asia, Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 57, 1998: 331\u2013344 Arab writer Al-Quazweeni (1204\u20131283) spoke of a tribe of people called Al-Dabeyoun meaning \"hyena people\". In his book Aajeb Al-Makhlouqat he wrote that should one of this tribe be in a group of 1000 people, a hyena could pick him out and eat him. A Persian medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure cannibalistic people known as kaftar, who are said to be \u201chalf-man, half-hyena\u201d. Al-Doumairy in his writings in Hawayan Al-Koubra (1406) wrote that striped hyenas were vampiric creatures that attacked people at night and sucked the blood from their necks. He also wrote that hyenas only attacked brave people. Arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones. In a similar vein to Al-Doumairy, the Greeks, until the end of the 19th century, believed that the bodies of werewolves, if not destroyed, would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas which drank the blood of dying soldiers. The image of striped hyenas in Afghanistan, India and Palestine is more varied. Though feared, striped hyenas were also symbolic for love and fertility, leading to numerous varieties of love medicine derived from hyena body parts. Among the Baluch and in northern India, witches or magicians are said to ride striped hyenas at night.The Arab word for striped hyenas, dhubba, is alluded in a valley in Israel known as Shaqq-ud-Diba (meaning \"cleft of the hyenas\") and Wadi-Abu-Diba (meaning \"valley of the hyenas\"). Both places have been interpreted by some scholars as being the Biblical Valley of Zeboim mentioned in 1 Samuel 13:18. The Hebrew word for hyena is tzebua or zevoa, which literally means \"howling creature\". Though the Authorized King James Version of the Bible interprets this word (which appears in Jeremiah 12:9) as referring to a \"speckled bird\", Henry Baker Tristram argued that it was most likely a hyena being mentioned.In gnostic thought, the Archon Astaphaios is depicted with a hyena face.The Apocryphon of John. Gnosis.org. Retrieved on 2013-03-21. Livestock and crop predationThe striped hyena is sometimes implicated in the killing of livestock, particularly goats, sheep, dogs and poultry. Larger stock is sometimes reportedly taken, though it is possible that these are cases of scavenging mistaken for actual predation. Although most attacks occur at low densities, a substantial number reputedly occur in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, and possibly Morocco. In Turkmenistan, they kill dogs, while they kill dogs, sheep and other small animals in the Caucasus. Striped hyenas were recorded to kill horses and donkeys in 1950s Iraq. Dogs, sheep and goats are occasionally at risk in Africa. Sheep and goats are also preyed upon in North Africa, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, and India, donkeys in North Africa, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, and India, horses in Iran and dogs in India.Striped hyenas also cause damage on occasion to melon fields and to date palms in date plantations in Israel and Egypt, and to water and honey melon plantations in Turkmenistan. Attacks on humans and grave desecration In ordinary circumstances, striped hyenas are extremely timid around humans, though they may show bold behaviours toward people at night. On rare occasions, striped hyenas have preyed on humans. In the 1880s, a hyena was reported to have attacked humans, especially sleeping children, over a three-year period in the Erivan Governorate, with 25 children and 3 adults being wounded in one year. The attacks provoked local authorities into announcing a reward of 100 rubles for every hyena killed. Further attacks were reported later in some parts of Transcaucasia, particularly in 1908. Instances are known in Azerbaijan of striped hyenas killing children sleeping in courtyards during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942, a sleeping guard was mauled in his hut by a hyena in Golyndzhakh. Cases of children being taken by hyenas by night are known in southeast Turkmenia's Bathyz Nature Reserve. A further attack on a child was reported around Serakhs in 1948. Several attacks have occurred in India ; in 1962, nine children were thought to have been taken by hyenas in the town of Bhagalpur in the Bihar State in a six-week period and 19 children up to the age of four were killed by hyenas in Karnataka, Bihar in 1974. A census on wild animal attacks during a five-year period in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh showed that hyenas had only attacked three people, the lowest figure when compared to deaths caused by wolves, gaur, boar, elephants, tigers, leopards and sloth bears.Though attacks on live humans are rare, striped hyenas will scavenge on human corpses. In Turkey, stones are placed on graves to stop hyenas digging the bodies out. In World War I, the Turks imposed conscription (safar barlek) on mount Lebanon. People escaping from the conscription fled north, where many died and were subsequently eaten by hyenas. Hunting Striped hyenas were hunted by Ancient Egyptian peasants for duty and amusement along with other animals that were a threat to crops and livestock. Algerian hunters historically considered the killing of striped hyenas as beneath their dignity, due to the animal's reputation for cowardice.Kingsley, John Sterling (1884) The Standard Natural History, Vol. V: Mammals, Boston: S. E. Cassino and Co. A similar attitude was held by British sportsmen in British India. Although striped hyenas are capable of quickly killing a dog with a single bite, they usually feign death when escape from hunting dogs is impossible, and will remain in this state for long periods, even when badly bitten. On some rare occasions, hyenas were ridden down and speared by men on horseback. Although hyenas were generally not fast enough to outrun horses, they had the habit of doubling and turning frequently during chases, thus ensuring long pursuits. Generally though, hyenas were hunted more as pests than sporting quarries; their scavenging damages skulls, skins and other articles from hunter's camps, which made them unpopular among sportsmen.Lydekker, Richard (1907), The game animals of India, Burma, Malaya, and Tibet, p. 354, London, R. Ward, limited In the Soviet Union, hyena hunting was not specially organised. Most hyenas were caught incidentally in traps meant for other animals. Some hunters in southern Punjab, Kandahar and Quetta, catch striped hyenas to use them in hyena-baiting. The hyenas are pitted against specially trained dogs, and are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary. In Kandahar, hunters locally called payloch (naked foot) hunt striped hyenas by entering their dens naked with a noose in hand. When the hyena is cornered at the end of its lair, the hunter murmurs the magic formula \u201cturn into dust, turn into stone,\u201d which causes the animal to enter a hypnotic state of total submission, by which point the hunter can slip a noose over its forelegs and, finally, drag it out of the cave. A similar method was once practised by Mesopotamian Arab hunters, who would enter hyena dens and \"flatter\" the animal, which they believed could understand Arabic. The hunter would murmur \"You are very nice and pretty and quite like a lion ; indeed, you are a lion\". The hyena would then allow the hunter to place a noose around its neck and pose no resistance on being dragged out of its lair.Because of its coarse and sparse pelage, the striped hyena is not considered a furbearer, with the few skins sold by hunters often being marketed as poor quality dog or wolf fur. Hyena skins were however once used in preparing chamois leather. The selling price of hyena pelts in the Soviet Union ranged from 45 kopeks to 1 ruble, 80 kopeks. Striped hyenas as food A mural depicted on Mereruka's tomb in Sakkara indicates that Old Kingdom Egyptians forcefed hyenas in order to fatten them up for food, though certain scholars have argued that the depicted animals were really aardwolves. Striped hyenas are still eaten by Egyptian peasants, Arabian Bedouins, Palestinian laborers, Sinai Bedouins and Tuaregs. In the Muslim regions of Sistan, Kohat, Bannu, and Cholistan, striped hyena meat is considered halal under the Shafiite school, and can therefore be consumed. This represents an exception to the rule that predatory animals are not to be eaten, due to their being haraam. This stems from the fact that the striped hyena is an omnivore, rather than a purely carnivorous animal. Among the Bedouin of Arabia, the striped hyena is permitted for human consumption, though hyena meat is generally considered more as a medicine than as food. Striped hyenas in folk magicThe Ancient Greeks and Romans believed the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, skin, and fat, as well as the ash of different parts of the striped hyena's body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena \u201cwould hold a couple peaceably together\u201d and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently play an important role in love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk's baraka. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man's genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (kus) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva at the woman of his desire, he will invariably get hold of her. This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of kus-e kaftar bay, as well as in Pashto of kus-e kaftar which literally mean \"it happens as smoothly as if you would look through the vulva of a female striped hyena\". In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression \u201cto possess the anus of a [striped] hyena\u201d which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena\u2019s penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons. TameabilityThe striped hyena is easily tamed and can be fully trained, particularly when young. Although the Ancient Egyptians did not consider striped hyenas sacred, they supposedly tamed them for use in hunting. When raised with a firm hand, they may eventually become affectionate and as amenable as well trained dogs, though they emit a strong odour which no amount of bathing will cover.Smith, A. Mervyn (1904), Sport and adventure in the Indian jungle, p. 292, London : Hurst and Blackett Although they kill dogs in the wild, striped hyenas raised in captivity can form bonds with them."}, {"description": "Die Streifenhy\u00e4ne (Hyaena hyaena) ist eine Raubtierart aus der Familie der Hy\u00e4nen (Hyaenidae).

Zus\u00e4tzlich legen sie Gruben neben h\u00e4ufig begangenen Strecken an, in die sie regelm\u00e4\u00dfig def\u00e4kieren.Bei aggressiven Begegnungen mit Artgenossen richten Streifenhy\u00e4nen ihre R\u00fcckenm\u00e4hne auf, wodurch sie gr\u00f6\u00dfer erscheinen. Zus\u00e4tzlich k\u00f6nnen sie ihren Schwanz heben und wie eine Flaschenb\u00fcrste str\u00e4uben. Kommt es zum Kampf, versuchen die Kontrahenten, sich gegenseitig in die Kehle oder in die Beine zu bei\u00dfen. Das unterlegene Tier kr\u00fcmmt seinen K\u00f6rper, senkt seine M\u00e4hne und schwingt seinen Kopf hin und her, w\u00e4hrend der Sieger aufrecht und mit erhobener M\u00e4hne stehen bleibt. Treffen sich zwei Tiere aus derselben Gruppe, nachdem sie getrennt waren, zeigen sie wie alle Eigentlichen Hy\u00e4nen ein typisches Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsverhalten. Sie beschnuppern die Nase und die Analdr\u00fcse des anderen und lecken seinen R\u00fccken. Der Schwanz ist bei diesen Begr\u00fc\u00dfungen aufgerichtet.Streifenhy\u00e4nen sind relativ leise Tiere, die wenig Laute von sich geben. An Lauten bekannt sind ein Heulen, das Jungtiere von sich geben, ein Kreischen, das zu h\u00f6ren ist, wenn sie erschrecken oder von Artgenossen gejagt werden, ein langgezogenes Br\u00fcllen, das mit der Verteidigungshaltung einhergeht, und ein Knurren, das w\u00e4hrend eines Kampfes ert\u00f6nt. Weithin schallende oder lachende Laute, wie sie von der T\u00fcpfelhy\u00e4ne bekannt sind, l\u00e4sst die Streifenhy\u00e4ne nicht erklingen. NahrungZwei Streifenhy\u00e4nen fressen den Kadaver eines Pferds \u2013 Zeichnung von Walter Heubach Streifenhy\u00e4nen sind Aasfresser, die auch selbst get\u00f6tete Beutetiere und pflanzliches Material verzehren. Einen Gutteil ihrer Nahrung macht das Aas gr\u00f6\u00dferer Wirbeltiere aus, die von T\u00fcpfelhy\u00e4nen, Geparden, Leoparden, L\u00f6wen oder Tigern gerissen wurden. Dank ihres kr\u00e4ftigen Gebisses k\u00f6nnen sie dicke Knochen oder Schildkr\u00f6tenpanzer zerbrechen, ihr effizientes Verdauungssystem verwertet alle K\u00f6rperteile eines Tiers mit Ausnahme der Haare, der Hufe und der H\u00f6rner. Die im Aas enthaltenen bakteriellen Gifte beeintr\u00e4chtigen weder ihr Verdauungs- noch ihr Immunsystem. Neben dem Aas gr\u00f6\u00dferer Tiere fressen sie kleine S\u00e4ugetiere, V\u00f6gel, Reptilien, Insekten und andere Kleintiere. Diese erlegen sie vermutlich in den meisten F\u00e4llen selbst. Wie das Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Aas und selbst gerissenen Beutetieren in ihrer Ern\u00e4hrung ist und ob sie in der Lage sind, selbst gr\u00f6\u00dfere Beutetiere zu erlegen, ist umstritten. Nach Meinung einiger Forscher k\u00f6nnten die gr\u00f6\u00dferen Streifenhy\u00e4nen im Norden des Verbreitungsgebiet durchaus selbst Gro\u00dftiere wie Schafe, Ziegen und Pferde jagen, die kleineren im S\u00fcden jedoch nicht.Rieger (1981), S. 3. Daneben erg\u00e4nzt pflanzliches Material ihren Speiseplan. So fressen sie in Afrika die Fr\u00fcchte der W\u00fcstendatteln, in Zentralasien die der \u00d6lweiden. In Israel fallen sie manchmal in Plantagen ein und verzehren Datteln und Melonen.In der N\u00e4he menschlicher Siedlungen bieten M\u00fclleimer ein willkommenes Nahrungsangebot. Aus mehreren Regionen gibt es Berichte, wonach Streifenhy\u00e4nen zumindest fr\u00fcher h\u00e4ufig Gr\u00e4ber aufgruben, um die Leichname herauszuholen und zu fressen. Auch Angriffe auf Menschen, insbesondere Kinder, kommen manchmal vor.Streifenhy\u00e4nen gehen stets einzelg\u00e4ngerisch auf Nahrungssuche, wenngleich sich bei einem gro\u00dfen Kadaver mehrere Tiere versammeln k\u00f6nnen. Bei der Nahrungssuche legen sie pro Nacht 7 bis 27 Kilometer zur\u00fcck und bewegen sich dabei entweder auf deutlichen Trampelpfaden oder in einem Zick-Zack-Kurs quer durch das Gel\u00e4nde fort. Sie sind f\u00e4hig, sich die Position eines fr\u00fcchtetragenden Baumes oder eines M\u00fclleimers zu merken, und kehren auch auf anderen Routen dorthin zur\u00fcck. Manchmal schleppen sie Nahrungs\u00fcberreste in ihre Baue, vermutlich um sie vor anderen Aasfressern in Sicherheit zu bringen.Sie sind in der Lage, salzhaltiges Wasser zu trinken, decken aber ihren Fl\u00fcssigkeitsbedarf h\u00e4ufig aus Fr\u00fcchten. FortpflanzungDie Paarung kann soweit bekannt das ganze Jahr \u00fcber erfolgen, es gibt keine Anzeichen f\u00fcr eine Saisonalit\u00e4t. \u00dcber das Balzverhalten in freier Wildbahn gibt es keine Beobachtungen. Das Fortpflanzungsverhalten ist entweder promiskuitiv, das hei\u00dft dass sich M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen jeweils mit mehreren Partnern paaren, oder polyandrisch, das hei\u00dft ein Weibchen pflanzt sich mit mehreren M\u00e4nnchen fort. Dabei paaren sich die Weibchen nicht nur mit den M\u00e4nnchen, mit denen sich ihr Revier \u00fcberlappt, sondern auch mit anderen. Rund die H\u00e4lfte aller W\u00fcrfe wird von mehr als einem M\u00e4nnchen gezeugt.Nach einer rund 90- bis 92-t\u00e4gigen Tragzeit bringt das Weibchen ein bis vier, in Gefangenschaft bis zu f\u00fcnf Jungtiere zur Welt. Die Neugeborenen wiegen rund 700 Gramm, ihr Fell gleicht dem der Ausgewachsenen mit Ausnahme der fehlenden M\u00e4hne, stattdessen haben sie einen dunklen Aalstrich. Ihre Augen und Ohren sind geschlossen, und sie k\u00f6nnen kaum krabbeln, sind also weniger entwickelt als beispielsweise neugeborene T\u00fcpfelhy\u00e4nen.Sie verbringen ihre ersten Lebenswochen im Bau der Mutter, nach f\u00fcnf bis neun Tagen \u00f6ffnen sich ihre Augen, nach rund zwei Wochen kommen sie erstmals ins Freie. Mit rund 30 Tagen beginnen die Geschwister eines Wurfs, miteinander zu spielen. Etwa zur gleichen Zeit nehmen sie erstmals Fleisch zu sich. Haupts\u00e4chlich die Weibchen k\u00fcmmern sich um den Nachwuchs, manchmal versorgen aber auch die M\u00e4nnchen oder bei Familiengruppen die \u00e4lteren Geschwister die Jungtiere mit Nahrung. Es dauert \u00fcber ein Jahr, bis die Jungtiere endg\u00fcltig entw\u00f6hnt werden, die Geschlechtsreife tritt ebenfalls im zweiten Lebensjahr ein. Das h\u00f6chste bekannte Lebensalter in menschlicher Obhut betrug 24 Jahre."}, {"description": "Allgemeiner K\u00f6rperbau und FellDie Streifenhy\u00e4ne ist die kleinste der drei Eigentlichen Hy\u00e4nen, aber deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer als die vierte Hy\u00e4nenart, der Erdwolf, mit dem sie \u00e4u\u00dferliche Merkmale wie das gestreifte Fell teilt. Sie erreicht eine Kopfrumpfl\u00e4nge von 100 bis 115 Zentimetern, wozu noch ein 30 bis 40 Zentimeter langer Schwanz kommt. Die Schulterh\u00f6he betr\u00e4gt 66 bis 75 Zentimeter, das Gewicht variiert zwischen 26 und 41 Kilogramm.Zahlen nach Holekamp & Kolowski (2009), S. 256. Es gibt keinen signifikanten Sexualdimorphismus hinsichtlich der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, das hei\u00dft, dass M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen ann\u00e4hernd gleich gro\u00df sind. Allerdings sind die Tiere im Norden des Verbreitungsgebietes geringf\u00fcgig gr\u00f6\u00dfer als Tiere im S\u00fcden.Das Fell ist relativ lang und erweckt einen zotteligen Eindruck. Der Schwanz ist buschig. Eine graue oder gelbgraue M\u00e4hne erstreckt sich von den Ohren entlang des R\u00fcckens bis zum Schwanz. Die M\u00e4hne kann aufgerichtet werden, wodurch das Tier deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer wirkt. Mit bis zu 20 Zentimeter langen Haaren an den Schultern haben Streifenhy\u00e4nen die l\u00e4ngste M\u00e4hne aller Hy\u00e4nen. Die Grundf\u00e4rbung des Fells ist hellgrau bis gelbgrau, an den Flanken verlaufen f\u00fcnf bis neun schwarze Streifen, die manchmal nur undeutlich zu sehen sind. An den Beinen befinden sich mehrere deutlicher sichtbare Querstreifen. Die Schnauze ist schwarz, ebenso der Kehlfleck und zwei Streifen an den Wangen.Wie alle Hy\u00e4nen sind Streifenhy\u00e4nen digitigrad (Zeheng\u00e4nger). Die Vorderbeine sind l\u00e4nger als die Hinterbeine, was den f\u00fcr diese Tiergruppe typischen fallenden R\u00fccken bedingt. Die Vorder- und die Hinterpfoten enden jeweils in vier Zehen, die mit stumpfen, nicht einziehbaren Krallen versehen sind.Streifenhy\u00e4nen haben eine gut entwickelte Analdr\u00fcse, deren Sekret zur Reviermarkierung eingesetzt wird. Die Weibchen haben zwei oder drei Paar Zitzen \u2013 wenn drei Paare vorhanden sind, sind nur die hinteren beiden Paare funktionell. Den M\u00e4nnchen fehlt wie bei allen Hy\u00e4nen der Penisknochen. \u00c4hnlich der T\u00fcpfelhy\u00e4ne zeigen Streifenhy\u00e4nen Besonderheiten im Bau des Genitaltraktes, allerdings nur bei heranwachsenden Tieren. Junge Weibchen haben aufgew\u00f6lbte Schamlippen vor der Vagina, diese W\u00f6lbungen sind unbehaart, dunkel und rau. Bei den jungen M\u00e4nnchen befinden sich weiche, unbehaarte Hautfalten vor dem Hodensack. Im Gegensatz zur T\u00fcpfelhy\u00e4ne sind diese Formen aber nicht so ausgepr\u00e4gt, als dass das Geschlecht nicht mehr bestimmt werden k\u00f6nnte. Diese W\u00f6lbungen sind nur in den ersten zwei Lebensjahren sichtbar, ausgewachsene Tiere zeigen einen unauff\u00e4lligen Bau der Genitalien. Kopf und Z\u00e4hneDer Bau des Sch\u00e4dels und der Z\u00e4hne der Streifenhy\u00e4ne gleicht dem der anderen Eigentlichen Hy\u00e4nen. Der Nacken und die Schultern sind massiv und kr\u00e4ftig. Der Kopf ist rundlich, die unbehaarte Schnauze breit gebaut. Die Augen weisen als Anpassung an die nachtaktive Lebensweise ein Tapetum lucidum auf, die Ohren sind lang und zugespitzt. Die Kiefer sind kr\u00e4ftig, die starke Kiefermuskulatur, insbesondere der Musculus temporalis hat einen hohen Sagittalkamm am Sch\u00e4del als Ansatzstelle.Die Zahnformel lautet I 3/3 \u2013 C 1/1 \u2013 P 4/3 M 1/1, insgesamt haben sie also 34 Z\u00e4hne. Die Schneidez\u00e4hne sind unauff\u00e4llig, ebenso die Eckz\u00e4hne. Die an das Aufbrechen von Knochen angepassten Pr\u00e4molaren sind hingegen vergr\u00f6\u00dfert und kr\u00e4ftig gebaut. Sie weisen eine komplexe Struktur des Zahnschmelzes auf, was ein Zerbrechen der Z\u00e4hne verhindert. Vor allem der dritte obere und der dritte untere Pr\u00e4molar werden f\u00fcr das Aufbrechen von Knochen verwendet. Der vierte obere Pr\u00e4molar und der untere Molar sind wie bei allen Landraubtieren zu Rei\u00dfz\u00e4hnen entwickelt; diese Z\u00e4hne sind klingenf\u00f6rmig gebaut und dienen dem Zerschneiden von Fleisch."}, {"description": "Streifenhy\u00e4ne im Tierpark Berlin In weiten Teilen ihres Verbreitungsgebietes haben Streifenhy\u00e4nen einen schlechten Ruf und gelten als feige oder dumme Tiere. Es sind einige abergl\u00e4ubische Vorstellungen mit ihnen verbunden: In Indien wird behauptet, die Zunge der Tiere reduziere die Gefahr von Tumoren und ihr Fett sei gut gegen Rheumatismus, in Nordafrika werden ihre Haare als Talisman benutzt und das Gehirn gilt als Aphrodisiakum. Im Alten \u00c4gypten wurden die Tiere gez\u00e4hmt und zu Jagdzwecken verwendet. Daneben wurden sie dort auch gem\u00e4stet und gegessen, es gibt davon bildliche Darstellungen, unter anderem auf der Mastaba von Mereruka.Tomb of Mereruka auf Egyptian Monuments, abgerufen am 4.

PDFDa sie manchmal Weidetiere rei\u00dfen und wegen der zumindest unterstellten Grabsch\u00e4ndungen und Attacken auf Menschen werden sie immer noch gejagt. Die Jagd wird h\u00e4ufig mit Giftk\u00f6dern durchgef\u00fchrt, mit denen Streifenhy\u00e4nen sehr leicht zu erlegen sind. Manchmal ist ihre Vergiftung auch unbeabsichtigt, so wurden sie in der Zwischenkriegszeit an der israelischen Mittelmeerk\u00fcste durch die britische Mandatsmacht ausgerottet. Ziel dieser Kampagne war eigentlich der als \u00dcbertr\u00e4ger der Tollwut gef\u00fcrchtete Goldschakal. Hinzu kommt das verminderte Nahrungsangebotes durch den Bestandsr\u00fcckgang der Raubtiere, sodass weniger Aas f\u00fcr die Hy\u00e4nen anf\u00e4llt. Eine weitere Gef\u00e4hrdung stellt der Automobilverkehr dar. Diese Gefahr wird dadurch gesteigert, dass Hy\u00e4nen h\u00e4ufig direkt auf der Stra\u00dfe die Kadaver von \u00fcberfahrenen Tieren fressen und dabei unvorsichtig gegen\u00fcber nachkommenden Fahrzeugen sind.Die Best\u00e4nde der Streifenhy\u00e4ne gehen zur\u00fcck. Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet ist heute zerst\u00fcckelt und auf viele kleine, isolierte Populationen aufgeteilt. Eine vorsichtige Sch\u00e4tzung beziffert die weltweite Gesamtpopulation auf 5.000 bis 14.000 Tiere.Holekamp & Kolowski (2009), S. 251.

Ultimate Ungulate The tapir is the largest land mammal in Central America.Like the other Latin American tapirs (the mountain tapir and the South American tapir), the Baird's tapir is commonly called danta by people in all areas. In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it is referred to as the anteburro.

Hunting by humans and habitat loss are the two major factors in the species' diminishing numbers.

In Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama, hunting of the Baird's tapirs is illegal, but the laws protecting them are often completely unenforced. Furthermore, restrictions against hunting do not address the problem of deforestation. Therefore, many conservationists focus on environmental education and sustainable forestry to try to save the Baird's tapir and other rainforest species from extinction.Attacks on humans are rare and normally in self-defense.

Die Gesamtpopulation brach ein, nachdem in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 20. Jahrhunderts 70 % der Regenw\u00e4lder Mittelamerikas durch Ausbau der Landwirtschaft, der Verkehrswege und die Ausdehnung der menschlichen Besiedlung vernichtet wurden und es so zu einer starken Fraktionierung der Lebensr\u00e4ume kam. Weitere Bedrohungen sind die Jagd und gezielte T\u00f6tung durch den Menschen, was in den meisten L\u00e4ndern illegal ist, aber auch die \u00dcbertragung von Krankheiten durch Hausrinder und andere landwirtschaftliche Nutztiere.A.

Er kann gut schwimmen und w\u00fchlt oft im Schlamm. Tapirgruppen kommen nur in der Brunftzeit oder als Mutter-Jungtier-Beziehung vor. Die Vertreter des Mittelamerikanischen Tapirs leben territorial in Revieren. Jene der M\u00e4nnchen sind dabei durchschnittlich 1,5\u00a0km\u00b2 gro\u00df, die der Weibchen mit 1\u00a0km\u00b2 nur wenig kleiner. Dabei \u00fcberlappen sich die Areale teilweise an den Grenzen. Die Variation der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines Territoriums \u00fcber das Jahr schwankt nur gering. Ein Revier umfasst in der Regel verschiedene Vegetationstypen, die von W\u00e4ldern \u00fcber Busch- zu Graslandschaften reichen, ausreichend Wasser ist allerdings eine Grundvoraussetzung. Bei der Wanderung zu den verschiedenen Aktivit\u00e4tszonen, wie Fress-, Rast- oder Schwimmpl\u00e4tzen, legt ein Tier Pfade an, die aber wahrscheinlich weniger strikt wiederbenutzt werden als beim Bergtapir. Allerdings werden diese auch, wie bei den anderen Tapirarten, mit Kot und Urin markiert, was h\u00e4ufig in Gew\u00e4ssern\u00e4he vorkommt. Dabei nutzt der Mittelamerikanische Tapir regelm\u00e4\u00dfig die gleichen Pl\u00e4tze, so dass nach einiger Zeit hohe Abfallhaufen entstehen. Die F\u00e4kalienhaufen dienen auch als wichtiges innerartliches Kommunikationsmittel.Charles R. Foerster and Christopher Vaughan: Home Range, Habitat Use, and Activity of Baird's Tapir in Costa Rica. Biotropica 34 (3), 2002, S. 423\u2013437 Ern\u00e4hrungsweiseDer Mittelamerikanische Tapir ist ein spezialisierter Pflanzenfresser und ern\u00e4hrt sich von Bl\u00e4ttern, Fr\u00fcchten, Zweigen und anderen Pflanzenteilen. Dabei machen faserige Pflanzenteile fast die H\u00e4lfte der aufgenommenen Nahrung aus. Die Bevorzugung weicher Pflanzenkost l\u00e4sst sich auch in der Anatomie anhand der niederkronigen Z\u00e4hne mit den Schmelzh\u00f6ckern und -leisten auf den Kaufl\u00e4chen und der r\u00fcsselartigen Nase und Oberlippe erkennen. Je nach Region sind 30 bis mehr als 60 Pflanzenarten aus bis zu 20 Familien bekannt, die vom Mittelamerikanischen Tapir verzehrt werden, die Gesamtartanzahl wird mit mehr als 90 angegeben. Dazu geh\u00f6ren unter anderem Aronstab-, Brechnuss- oder Gesneriengew\u00e4chse, des Weiteren auch Buchengew\u00e4chse und S\u00fc\u00dfgr\u00e4ser.Feng Mei Wu Chen: Ecology of the Central American Tapir (Tapirus bairdii, Tapiridae) on a High Elevation Mountain Cloud Forest of Costa Rica.

Dass die Tapirart derartige Stellen m\u00f6glicherweise nicht nutzt, k\u00f6nnte mit der h\u00e4ufig eher k\u00fcstennahen Verbreitung und dem \u00dcberwiegen von kalksteinreichen Felsformationen im mittelamerikanischen Gebirgshochland zusammenh\u00e4ngen.Olga Lucia Montenegro: The behaviour of Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) at an natural mineral lick in the Peruvian Amazon. University of Florida 1998 (S. 7) (PDF) FortpflanzungMit mindestens drei Jahren ist der Mittelamerikanische Tapir geschlechtsreif. Beim weiblichen Tier setzt die Brunft alle 25 bis 38 Tage ein und h\u00e4lt etwa einen Tag an. W\u00e4hrend dieser Zeit werben die M\u00e4nnchen um das Weibchen. Die Tragzeit nach der Begattung, die zum Teil auch im Wasser stattfinden kann, dauert zwischen 384 und 399 Tage. In der Regel bringt das Muttertier ein einzelnes Jungtier zur Welt. Dieses ist - wie alle Tapirk\u00e4lber - mit einem hellen, tarnenden Streifenmuster versehen, das sich im Lauf des zweiten Lebenshalbjahres verliert. W\u00e4hrend der ersten zehn Tage bleibt das Kalb in einem Versteck, dann folgt es aktiv dem Muttertier. Mit rund einem Jahr ist das Jungtier endg\u00fcltig entw\u00f6hnt und selbst\u00e4ndig.Janine L. Brown, Scott B.

Die heutigen f\u00fcnf Vertreter der Gattung haben unterschiedlichste Verwandtschaftsgrade. Molekulargenetischen Untersuchungen zufolge trennte sich zuerst der asiatische Schabrackentapir (Tapirus indicus) vor 21 bis 23 Millionen Jahren von der Linie der Tapire ab, ihm folgte der Mittelamerikanische Tapir vor 19 bis 20 Millionen Jahren. Sehr viel sp\u00e4ter, n\u00e4mlich erst vor rund 3,5 Millionen Jahren, spalteten sich dann die s\u00fcdamerikanischen Vertreter ab.Mary V. Ashley, Jane E.

Dabei konnte das Vorkommen von zwei getrennten Gruppen ermittelt werden, die sich vor rund 2,4 Millionen Jahren trennten. Eine der Gruppen bewohnt mit Mexiko und Guatemala eher den n\u00f6rdlichen Teil des Verbreitungsgebietes und spaltete sich ihrerseits noch einmal vor rund 600.000 Jahren auf. Die zweite Gruppe umfasst die s\u00fcdlichen Populationen, die ebenfalls eine weitere Spaltung vor rund 1,7 Millionen Jahren erfuhren.

To cross disturbances such as plantations and logged areas, southern flying squirrels prefer to use mature forest corridors over younger ones, suggesting that they are more sensitive to forest disturbances than previously believed."}, {"description": "Flying squirrels do not actually fly, but rather glide using a membrane called a patagium. From atop of trees, flying squirrels can initiate glides from a running start or from a stationary position by bringing their limbs under the body, retracting their heads, and then propelling themselves off the tree.Banfield AWF. (1974). The mammals of Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. It is believed that they use triangulation to estimate the distance of the landing area as they often lean out and pivot from side to side before jumping.Walker EP, Paradiso JL. (1975). Mammals of the world. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Once in the air, they form an \"X\" with their limbs by spreading their long arms forward and out and their long legs backward and out, causing their membrane to stretch into a square-like shape and glide down at angles of 30 to 40 degrees. They manoeuvre with great efficiency in the air, making 90 degree turns around obstacles if needed. Just before reaching a tree, they raise their flattened tails that abruptly changes their trajectory upwards, and point all of their limbs forward to create a parachute effect with the membrane in order to reduce the shock of landing. The limbs absorb the remainder of the impact, and the squirrels immediately run to the other side of the trunk or to the top of the tree in order to avoid any potential predators. Although graceful in flight, they are very clumsy walkers and if they happen to be on the ground in the presence of danger, they will prefer to hide rather than attempt an escape."}, {"description": "Southern flying squirrels have grey brown fur on top with darker flanks and are a cream color underneath. They have large dark eyes and a flattened tail. They have a furry membrane called a patagium that extends between the front and rear legs and is used to glide through the air.Southern flying squirrels feed on fruit and nuts from trees such as red and white oak, hickory and beech. They store food, especially acorns, for winter consumption. They also dine on insects, buds, mushrooms, mycorrhizal fungi, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings and flowers. Predators include snakes,E.g.rat snakes, namely Elaphe obsoleta: Medlin & Risch (2006) owls, hawks and raccoons. Domestic house cats can be dangerous to these animals. Both in the wild and in captivity they can produce two litters each year (with 2-7 young per litter). The gestation period is approximately 40 days. Young are born without fur or any capabilities of its own. Their ears open at 2 to 6 days old, and fur grows in by 7 days. Their eyes don't open until they are 24\u201330 days old. Parents leave their young 65 days after they are born. The young then become fully independent at around 120 days of age.Southern flying squirrels show substantial homing abilities, and can return to their nests if artificially removed to distances of up to a kilometre. Their home ranges may be up to 40,000 square metres for females and double that for males, tending to be larger at the northern extreme of their range.Exposure to southern flying squirrels has been linked to cases of epidemic typhus in humans.eMedicine - Typhus: Article Excerpt by Jason F Okulicz Typhus spread by flying squirrels is known as \"sylvatic typhus\" and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented a total of 39 such cases in the U.S. from 1976 to 2001.Sylvatic Typhus Fact Sheet, Pennsylvania Department of Health Downloaded on 24 January 2010.

Compared to individuals who nest alone in winter, squirrels in aggregates can save 30 percent more energy. Although southern flying squirrels do show a preference for relatedness, they are tolerant of nonrelated but familiar individuals, possibly because in addition to providing heat energy for the aggregation, outsiders will promote outbreeding.Thorington KK, Weigl PD.

However, Layne and Raymond observed nest boxes in Florida and discovered that the southern populations also nest in large groups (up to 25 individuals) and that, compared to northern populations, the period of elevated communal nesting extended later in the spring. In this study, nest temperatures occasionally exceeded 38\u00b0C while the normal body temperature of southern flying squirrels varies between 36.3 and 38.9\u00b0C.

Proposed advantages of aggregation include increase likelihood of mating, increased defense against predators, or increased foraging success.Populations which nest together were found to be more highly related than expected by chance and it is believed this could be a form of kin selection since an individual's stored food may be beneficial for the survival of its relatives in the event of death.Thorington KK, Metheny JD, Kalcounis-Rueppell MC, Weigl PD.

When burying dry nuts in dry substrate, no odors are present and spatial memory is the most effective retrieval mechanism, suggesting that there is no inclusive fitness involved in the hoarding behavior. However, once placed in a wet environment, smell becomes an effective means to retrieve the food and decreases the individuals advantage over the other members of the group. Experiments to determine whether a squirrel would steal from others in the group revealed that no particular pattern exists and that the hidden food is recovered according to its availability."}, {"description": "The southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is one of two species of the genus Glaucomys, the only flying squirrels found in North America (the other is the somewhat larger northern flying squirrel G. sabrinus).

It has even benefited from the spread of agriculture and creation of man-made waterholes. However competition with livestock and rabbits poses a threat. It is also sometimes shot by farmers as a pest although a \"destruction permit\" is required from the relevant state government.Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of vehicles, severely damaging or destroying smaller or unprotected vehicles. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact. As a result, \"kangaroo crossing\" signs are commonplace in Australia. Commercial useThe kangaroo is so numerous that there is regulated harvest of its hide and meat. Hunting permits and commercial harvesting are controlled under nationally approved management plans, which aim to maintain red kangaroo populations and manage them as a renewable resource. Harvesting of kangaroos is controversial, particularly due to the animal's popularity.In the year 2000, 1,173,242 animals were killed. In 2009 the government put a limit of 1,611,216 for the number of red kangaroos available for commercial use.

It typically inhabits open habitats with some trees for shade.Dawson, T.J. (1995) Kangaroos: Biology of the Largest Marsupials. UNSW Press, Sydney ISBN 0-8014-8262-3. Red kangaroos are capable of conserving enough water and selecting enough fresh vegetation to survive in an arid environment. The kangaroo\u2019s kidneys are also great at concentrating urine, particularly during summer. Red kangaroo primarily eat green vegetation, particularly fresh grasses and forbs, and can get enough even when most plants look brown and dry. One study of kangaroos in Central Australia found that green grass makes up 75\u201395% the diet, with Eragrostis setifolia dominating at 54%. This grass continues to be green into the dry season. Kangaroos also primarily consumed this species, along with Enneapogon avanaceus, in western New South Wales where they comprised much as 21\u201369% of its diet according to a study. During dry times, kangaroos search for green plants by staying on open grassland and near watercourses. While grasses and forbs are preferred, red kangaroos will also eat certain species of chenopods, like Bassia diacantha and Maireana pyramidata, and will even browse shrubs when its favoured foods are scarce. However, some perennial chenopods, such as round-leaf chenopod Kochia are avoided even when abundant.At times, red kangaroos congregate in large numbers; in areas with much forage, these groups can number as much as 1,500 individuals. Red kangaroos are mostly crepuscular and nocturnal, resting in the shade during the day. However, they sometimes move about during the day. Red kangaroos rely on small saltbushes or mulga bushes for shelter in extreme heat rather than rocky outcrops or caves. Grazing takes up most of their daily activities. Like most kangaroo species, they are mostly sedentary, staying within a relatively well-defined home range. However, great environmental changes can cause them to travel great distances. Kangaroos in New South Wales have weekly home ranges of 258\u2013560 ha, with the larger areas belonging to adult males.Croft, D. B. (1991). \"Home range of the red kangaroo Macropus rufus,\" Journal of Arid Environments 20:83\u201398. When forage is poor and rainfall patchy, kangaroos will travel 25\u201330\u00a0km to more favourable feeding grounds. Another study of kangaroos in central Australia found that most of them stay close to remaining vegetation but disperse to find fresh plants after it rains. The red kangaroo is too big to be subject to significant non-human predation. They can use their robust legs and clawed feet to defend themselves from attackers with kicks and blows. However, dingoes and eagles will kill and eat joeys. Joeys are thus protected in their mother's pouch. The red kangaroo formerly did have major predators that are now extinct. Extinct predators included the marsupial lion, megalania, and the wonambi. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.Canadian Museum of Nature \u2013 Kangaroo. Retrieved 6 January 2007."}, {"description": "This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a squared-off muzzle. Males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Females are smaller than males and are blue-grey with a brown tinge, pale grey below, although arid zone females are coloured more like males. It has two forelimbs with small claws, two muscular hind-limbs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used to create a tripod when standing upright.The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion.

These include having an insulating layer of fur, being less active and staying in the shade when temperatures are high, panting, sweating, and licking its forelimbs.The red kangaroo's range of vision is approximately 300\u00b0, due to the position of its eyes."}, {"description": "Red kangaroos live in groups of 2\u20134 members. The most common groups are females and their young. Larger groups can be found in densely populated areas and females are usually with a male. Membership of these groups is very flexible, and males (boomers) are not territorial, fighting only over females (flyers) that come into heat. Males develop proportionately much larger shoulders and arms than females. Most agonistic interactions occur between young males, which engage in ritualised fighting known as boxing. They usually stand up on their hind limbs and attempt to push their opponent off balance by jabbing him or locking forearms. If the fight escalates, they will begin to kick each other. Using their tail to support their weight, they deliver kicks with their powerful hind legs. Compared to other kangaroo species, fights between red kangaroo males tend to involve more wrestling. Fights establish dominance relationships among males, and determine who gets access to estrous females. Alpha males make agonistic behaviours and more sexual behaviours until they are overthrown. Displaced males live alone and avoid close contact with others. Reproduction The red kangaroo breeds all year round. The females have the unusual ability to delay birth of their baby until their previous Joey has left the pouch. This is called embryonic diapause. Copulation may last 25 minutes. The red kangaroo has the typical reproductive system of a kangaroo. The neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long. Its hind legs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the two teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After approximately 190\u00a0days, the baby (called a joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after around 235\u00a0days, it leaves the pouch for the last time.Evolution of Biodiversity, BCB705 Biodiversity, University of the Western Cape While the young joey will permanently leave the pouch at around 235\u00a0days old, it will continue to suckle until it reaches about 12\u00a0months of age. A doe may first reproduce as early as 18 months of age and as late as five years during drought, but normally she is two and a half years old before she begins to breed.The female kangaroo is usually permanently pregnant, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, red kangaroo mothers may \"have up to three generations of offspring simultaneously; a young-at-foot suckling from an elongated teat, a young in the pouch attached to a second teat and a blastula in arrested development in the uterus\".Dale R. McCullough and Yvette McCullough, (2000) Kangaroos in Outback Australia, Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-11916-X.The kangaroo has also been observed to engage in alloparental care, a behavior in which a female may adopt another females joey. This is a common parenting behavior seen in many other animal species like wolves, elephants and fathead minnows.Riedman, Marianne L.

Within Lemuriformes, it belongs to the family Cheirogaleidae, which contains the mouse lemurs, dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and hairy-eared dwarf lemur. The mouse lemur genus Microcebus includes the smallest primates in the world. Phylogenetic analyses of D-loop DNA sequences of various lemur species suggests that the gray mouse lemur may be most closely related to the reddish-gray mouse lemur (M.\u00a0griseorufus).First described in 1777 by English illustrator John Frederick Miller, M.\u00a0murinus remained the only species of its genus, as well as the name used for all mouse lemurs on Madagascar, between the first major taxonomic revision in 1931 and an extensive field study conducted in 1972.

Upon this revision, the gray mouse lemur was thought to account for all mouse lemurs that lived in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur represented the eastern rainforest mouse lemurs. More recently, scientific understanding of the distribution and diversity of the mouse lemurs has become much more complex. Additional field studies, genetic testing, and resulting taxonomic revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new mouse lemur species, demonstrating that the genus includes at least 17 cryptic species."}, {"description": "The gray or lesser mouse lemur is named for its brownish-gray fur and mouse-like size and appearance. The genus name, Microcebus, derives from the Greek words mikros, meaning \"small\", and kebos, meaning \"monkey\". The Latin version of kebos, cebus, is a common suffix used for primate names, despite the fact that the gray mouse lemur is a lemur, and not a monkey. The species name, murinus, means \"mouse-like\" and derives from the Latin word mus, or \"mouse\", and the Latin suffix -inus, which means \"like\".The lemur is known locally by several names in Malagasy, depending upon the region. Around T\u00f4lanaro (Fort Dauphin), it is called pondiky . In the northern end of its range, it is known as tsidy . Around Morondava, it is referred to as koitsiky , titilivaha , and vakiandry . In many cases, these Malagasy names are also used for other visually indistinguishable mouse lemur species that live within its range."}, {"description": "Like all other members of the family Cheirogaleidae, the gray mouse lemur is nocturnal and arboreal. It inhabits lowland tropical dry forest, sub-arid thorn scrub, gallery forest, spiny forest, eastern littoral forest, dry deciduous forests, semi-humid deciduous, moist lowland forest, transitional forest, and secondary forests or degraded forests (including plantations) all ranging up to 800 m above sea level. The species is more common in secondary forest than in primary forest, particularly bush and scrub habitat, where it occupies a \"fine branch\" niche, restricting the vertical range to fine branches, fine terminal supports, lianas and dense foliage. These lemurs are usually seen on branches less than 5 cm in diameter. The gray mouse lemur tends to prefer lower levels of the forest and the understory, where branches and vegetation are dense.In secondary forest, it is generally observed from ground level up to 10 m above ground, yet 15 to in the canopy of primary forest. Studies have found that the species can spend as much as 40% of its time below 3 m, with 70% of its time spent at this level during the end of the dry season, when plant food is limited and insects compose a larger percentage of the diet. The species is more numerous in spiny forest, such as the Andohahela Special Reserve, than in the gallery forest, preferring drier, littoral forest, whereas the brown mouse lemur prefers inland rain forest.The limits of the distribution are poorly understood. It is believed to range from the Onilahy River or Lake Tsimanampetsotsa in the south to Ankarafantsika National Park in the north. There is also an isolated and disjointed population in the southeastern part of the island, near T\u00f4lanaro and the Andohahela National Park, up to the Mandena Conservation Zone. Individuals tend to occupy small home ranges of 1 to. The gray mouse lemur is also sympatric with the reddish-gray mouse lemur, golden-brown mouse lemur, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, and several other cheirogaleid lemurs. In Ankarafantsika National Park, where it coexists with the golden-brown mouse lemur, the gray mouse lemur's relative population density was highest at higher altitudes and in drier habitat, while the golden-brown mouse lemur preferred the opposite. Another study has looked at the coexistence of the gray mouse lemur and Madame Berthe's mouse lemur and found small, exclusive clusters of each species and a high degree of feeding niche overlap.The gray mouse lemur can reach high population densities up to several hundred individuals per square kilometer (up to 167 individuals/km2 at Ankarafantsika National Park to 712 individuals/km2 at Kirindy Mitea National Park). This abundance is not uniform and tends to concentrate in \"population nuclei\", suggesting that it is difficult to accurately estimate population densities when extrapolating from a small area (from various studies) to a large area. The difficulty in finding individuals during some times of the year, particularly during the dry periods, can further complicate the problem of estimating population densities.Mouse lemurs are omnivorous, and favor fruit and insects for the bulk of their diet. The gray mouse lemur may even come down to the ground to catch insect prey, though it quickly returns to the protective cover of the understory to consume its catch. Nectar is also a part of the gray mouse lemur's diet, making it a potential pollinator for local plant species. A single instance of a male cannibalizing an adult female is known. Predation The most significant predators of the gray mouse lemur are the Madagascar long-eared owl and barn owl. Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation does not appear to have a drastic effect on its populations. Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native colubrid snake) and the Madagascar tree boa, as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.Due to its non-gregarious nature, the gray mouse lemur, like other nocturnal lemurs, primarily defends itself from predators using avoidance strategies, although group defense through the use of alarm calls and predator mobbing has been observed in this species. Studies involving the placement of predator and non-predator fecal odor with captive populations have demonstrated a genetic predisposition for predator recognition through the detection of metabolites from meat digestion. The mouse lemurs were shown to avoid locations where they typically received rewards, as well as exhibit increased activity and anti-predator behavior, when the odor of predator feces were present in that vicinity, but not when the fecal odor of Malagasy non-predators was present.During the day, when they are most vulnerable, individuals shelter inside tree holes, sometimes forming nests. They may use three to nine different tree holes within their home range, yet individuals may use one particular hole for up to five consecutive days. Mouse lemurs tend to prefer tree hollows, but also commonly make spherical constructions out of leaves. Nests are usually found in tree holes with a minimum diameter of 5 cm, with a median of 13 cm, suggesting that this range in diameter of tree holes may be crucial for maintaining a healthy habitat. The gray mouse lemur also spends most of its time in dense vegetation, limiting its visibility and accessibility to predators. Furthermore, it has a high reproductive rate to counter losses to predation."}, {"description": "The gray mouse lemur was listed in Appendix\u00a01 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1975, declaring it as threatened with extinction and prohibiting international trade of specimens except for non-commercial use, such as scientific research. The 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment lists it as a species of Least Concern (LC) with a decreasing population trend.Its greatest threats are habitat loss from slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle-grazing, as well as live capture for the local pet trade in the northern and southern parts of its range. Although this species inhabits secondary forests, studies have shown that decreased habitat quality adversely affects its populations since fewer tree holes offer fewer opportunities to conserve energy, increasing stress and mortality. One study found nine species of parasites in the fecal matter of the gray mouse lemur living in forests that suffered degradation and fragmentation. In small fragments of good quality forest, as well as forests with high levels of degradation, the gray mouse lemur showed a higher prevalence of parasitic nematodes and protozoans than those in larger good quality forest fragments. Studies in the late 1960s and 1970s showed that heavy logging between 1968 and 1970 seemed to result in decreased body weight, the use of smaller trees for nesting sites, and a smaller maximum female nesting group size (down to 7 from 15). There is also a concern that although daily torpor can help conserve energy and resources during moderate food shortages, extended food shortages brought about by climate change could create too much stress and severely impact the survivability of the species.The gray mouse lemur is considered one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals, found in seven national parks, five special reserves, the Berenty Private Reserve, and other privately protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone.This species of mouse lemur breeds very well in captivity, although it is not commonly displayed in zoos like some larger, diurnal lemurs. In 1989, more than 370 individuals were housed by 14 International Species Information System (ISIS) and non-ISIS institutions across the United States and Europe, 97% of which were captive born. In March 2009, 167 were registered at 29 ISIS institutions, including the Duke Lemur Center."}, {"description": "The gray mouse lemur is nocturnal, sleeping during the day in tree holes lined with leaf litter or purpose-built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves, moss and twigs. It usually forages alone at night, but may sleep in groups during the day, the composition of which depends on gender and season. Tree holes can be shared with up to 15 other individuals, although males tend to sleep alone while females tend to share nests. All mouse lemurs are highly active at night, often scurrying like mice and leaping over 3 m, using the tail as a balancing organ. When moving among the terminal branches of bushes and trees, they grip using all four feet and move with four legs. When on the ground, either to catch insects or cross short open areas, mouse lemurs hop like a frog. When hunting, the grey mouse lemur is known to catch invertebrates and small vertebrates with quick hand grasps.In the dry season, the gray mouse lemur faces the challenge of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to \ufb01nd food resources in the absence of sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.Foraging behavior is often slow, with height and direction changing continuously. Predation of insects occurs primarily on the ground. Before descending, the ear pinnae move alternately to help pinpoint the precise location of their prey. Insects are captured during a rapid dash across the leaf litter and are transported by mouth up into the relative safety of the branches. Studies with captive gray mouse lemurs have shown that vision is primarily used for prey detection, although the other senses certainly play a role in foraging.The gray mouse lemur is omnivorous, feeding primarily on fruit and invertebrates. Local populations appear to specialize on locally available fruit. At both Marosalaza and Mandena, beetles are the primary insect prey, although moths, praying mantids, fulgorid bugs, crickets, cockroaches, and spiders are also eaten. Less than half the diet consists of insects, with fruit making up a slightly larger fraction. This lemur also consumes flowers, gums and nectar from Euphorbia and Terminalia trees, leaves (Uapaca sp.), exudates (Homopteran larvae secretions), and small vertebrates such as tree frogs, geckos, and chameleons. Its diet is seasonally varied and diverse in content, giving it a very broad feeding niche compared to other species such as the Madame Berthe's mouse lemur. Therefore it is affected more by food availability than by niche partitioning where sympatry occurs. DormancyAs with all members of the mouse lemur genus, the gray mouse lemur is known to enter short states of daily torpor, particularly during the cool, dry Southern Hemisphere winter. This rare trait in primates, coupled with the ease of observing the species within its wide geographic distribution and its good representation in captivity, makes it a popular subject for research as a model organism. The gray mouse lemur is unique among the mouse lemurs studied so far because it is the only species to exhibit prolonged seasonal torpor, but this behavior has only been observed to occur in one locality. Activity patterns can differ noticeably between sexes as well as populations. At the Ampijoroa Forestry Station in Ankarafantsika National Park, males and females exhibit daily, rather than seasonal torpor. At Kirindy Forest, both sexes share the same daily torpor, yet during the dry season (April/May through September/October), females become completely inactive for several weeks or up to five months to conserve energy and reduce predation. However, males rarely remain inactive for more than a few days and become extremely active before the females revive from torpor, allowing them to establish hierarchies and territories for the breeding season. The use of alternative energy-saving strategies under the same environmental conditions was observed directly in 2008, providing the first physiological confirmation from the field. This pattern of seasonal versus daily torpor may relate to the seasonality of the region, since Kirindy is the only location west of the eastern mountain rainforests that experiences very low temperatures at night during the winter months. By entering extended torpor, sometimes referred to as hibernation, this would reduce the thermoregulatory stress in females, whereas males remain more active in preparation for the upcoming mating season. No difference in mortality has been shown between hibernating females and active males.During torpor, the gray mouse lemur's metabolic rate slows and its body temperature drops to the ambient temperature, as low as 7 \u00b0C. During the cooler months of May though August, the species selects tree holes closer to ground level, where ambient temperatures remain more stable. This allows them to remain in torpor longer, and to conserve metabolic resources. One study showed that during the breeding season, both males and females reduced their energy expenditure by 20% when they nested in pairs, and a maximal energetic benefit of 40% was achieved when three mouse lemurs nested together. Even during the nonbreeding season, maximal energetic gain was observed two or more animals nested together, because resting metabolic rate was already decreased.While the gray mouse lemur is found in both primary and secondary deciduous forests, they have lower population densities in secondary forests. This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter torpor during the dry season, especially for females, which tend to hibernate longer than males. In primary forests, they can maintain daily torpor or hibernation as long as their body temperatures remain below 28 \u00b0C, but in secondary forests that have fewer large trees, temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur's ability to maintain torpor for prolonged periods of time. In addition, the gray mouse lemur in secondary forests tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests, as well as lower survival rates. This is likely because those with lower body mass are less likely to enter torpor, and therefore expend around 40% more energy than those that do maintain torpor.This unusual ability for a primate to exhibit dormancy, in addition to the diminutive size, has led researchers to speculate that ancestral lemurs, and possibly ancestral primates, may have shared some traits with mouse lemurs. Consequently, the gray mouse lemur has once again been used as a model organism for studying lemur and primate evolution. For example, lemurs are thought to have colonized Madagascar by rafting to the island around 60 million years ago according to molecular phylogenetic studies. Before the discovery that ocean currents were the opposite of what they are today, thus favoring such an event, it was thought that it would have taken too long for any animal not capable of entering a state of dormancy to survive the trip. Therefore the mouse lemurs, such as the gray mouse lemur, were thought to have shared this plesiomorphic (ancestral) trait with the ancestral lemurs. Social systemsThe gray mouse lemur is described as solitary but social, foraging alone at night, but frequently sleeping in groups during the day. This social pattern varies by gender, season, and location. Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring, whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season. Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable, consisting of two to nine individuals, although a male may be found with a group of females outside the breeding season. During the breeding season (September through October), males and females may sleep in the same tree hole. Mixed sex groups can be common at this time, with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males.Research has shown that home ranges for the gray mouse lemur are usually small, possibly less than 50 m. Males typically travel further at night and have home ranges that are twice as large as those of females, often overlapping with one another, and always overlapping with at least one female's home range. Male home ranges increase threefold during the breeding season.Female home ranges overlap less than those of males, although localized concentrations, or \"population nuclei\", tend to form in some areas, where the sex ratio favors females to males by three or four to one at the nucleus core. Genetic studies indicate that females arrange themselves spatially in clusters (\"population nuclei\") of related individuals, while males tend to emigrate from their natal group. Research has shown that females in this species may maintain smaller ranges and associate more closely with other females than in some other mouse lemur species due to a more opportunistic feeding niche and, in the case of populations at Kirindy, the use of extended, seasonal torpor. Communication Vocalizations and scent are the primarily modes of communication within this species. Home ranges are scent marked with urine and feces. Vocalizations are complex and very high-pitched (ranging from 10 to 36\u00a0kHz), sometimes beyond the range of human hearing (0.02 to 20\u00a0kHz). These include calls for seeking contact, mating, distant communication, alarm, and distress.Like other mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur uses what has been described as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.As with other social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and identity of the individual. Dialects have also been detected between communities. The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is much like a bird song in terms of its ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 to 35\u00a0kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9\u00a0seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute. Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme. These calls are not genetically programmed. During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call, which show high degrees of variability. Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors, when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood. This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.Because mouse lemurs are cryptic species, and therefore visually indistinguishable, their social calls help individuals select mates of their own species. This differentiated signaling and recognition system has promoted species cohesiveness through premating isolation, and helped researchers distinguish and identify species. Breeding and reproductionThe mating system is described as multi-male and multi-female. Males establish dominance hierarchies prior to the mating season, however, some studies in the wild have shown no male aggression or visible competition for receptive females. Males in captivity become highly aggressive and form strict dominance hierarchies. These captive males may show the highest plasma testosterone levels found in mammals, and even the odor of a dominant male can lower the testosterone levels and sexually inhibit a subordinate male. During the breeding season, male testes increase significantly in size, facilitating sperm competition due to female promiscuity. Studies with the gray mouse lemur have shown that the optimal insemination period, during which a male is most likely to sire offspring, occurs early during a female's receptivity. Only during the mating season does male mortality rise above that of female mortality.Although the gray mouse lemur displays multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, studies have shown that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1\u20137 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.The gray mouse lemur is sexually dimorphic in terms of body mass, which fluctuates annually with the breeding season. Male body mass increases prior to the mating season, which is believed advantageous in searching for receptive females in estrus, and enabling them to maintain shorter periods of torpor. The study found that this is because males exhibit continued activity during the dry season while females hibernate. Thus, sexual dimorphism in terms of body size is dependent on environmental conditions and can therefore vary by season, location, population, and individuals' specific behavior.The females are receptive for 45 to 55\u00a0days between September and October, with estrus lasting 1 to 5\u00a0days. Females advertise estrus by distinctive high-frequency calls and scent-marking. Gestation lasts 54 to 68\u00a0days, averaging 60\u00a0days, typically resulting in 2 or 3\u00a0offspring weighing 5 g each. Infants are born in a leaf nest or tree hole in November prior to the onset of the rainy season. Weaning occurs after 25\u00a0days, and the infants are either left in the nest or carried in the mother's mouth and deposited on a branch while she forages. Infant mouse lemurs do not cling to the mother's fur. Independence is attained in 2\u00a0months, while sexual maturity is reached at 10 to 29\u00a0months in females and 7 to 19\u00a0months in males. Closely related females remain loosely associated after maturation (female philopatry), whereas males disperse from their natal area. In the wild, the gray mouse lemur's reproductive lifespan is no more than 5\u00a0years, although captive specimens have reportedly lived as long as 15\u00a0years and 5\u00a0months.The gray mouse lemur uses cooperative breeding as a form of family insurance. The female regularly transfers her offspring to other females' nests\u2014and likewise grooms and cares for offspring other than her own. While this can have a high physiological cost on a lactating female that is already expending a lot of energy, it can be beneficial overall to insuring survival among closely related groups with high mortality risk. A study that took place over three breeding seasons showed that closely related females form breeding groups mainly when there is a shortage of suitable roosts; when there is an advantage of a communal nest for defense, or when there are thermoregulatory benefits. In the event of offspring adoption, when a parent dies and a closely related female takes over care, it is believed that this is beneficial to groups with high mortality risk."}, {"description": "The gray mouse lemur shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, including soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe down the back (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.The gray mouse lemur is one of the smallest primates in the world, yet it is also the largest mouse lemur. Its total length is 25 to, with a head-body length of 12 to and a tail length of 13 to. The average weight for this species is 60 g, with ranges of 58 and and 40 and reported. This is smaller than the world's smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset, which ranges between 85 and. Weight varies by season, with both sexes building fat reserves, up to 35% of their body weight, in the tail and hind legs prior to the dry season and periods of dormancy. The tail of the gray mouse lemur can increase fourfold in volume during the wet season when it is storing fat. Even in captivity when environmental limitations are not an issue, mouse lemurs have shown a seasonal dietary preference with a greater protein intake during what would be their more active season.Researchers have identified differences in the tooth morphology of the first and second molars between the gray mouse lemur and the reddish-gray mouse lemur. In the reddish-gray mouse lemur, the first lower molar (m1) is squared and both the first and second upper molars (M1 and M2) have slight indentations around the middle of the posterior margin. The gray mouse lemur has a more elongated m1 and lacks the aforementioned indentation on M1 and M2. In terms of its general dentition, the gray mouse lemur shares the same dental formula as all other members of its family, Cheirogaleidae: This species has 66 chromosomes, closely resembling the karyotype of the dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus). Except for the X chromosome, all chromosomes are acrocentric (with the short arm absent or virtually absent). Its genome size is 3.12\u00a0picograms\u00a0(pg)."}, {"description": "The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), or lesser mouse lemur, is a small lemur, a type of strepsirrhine primate, found only on the island of Madagascar. Weighing 58 to, it is the largest of the mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus), a group that includes the smallest primates in the world. The species is named for its mouse-like size and coloration and is known locally (in Malagasy) as tsidy, koitsiky, titilivaha, pondiky, and vakiandry. The gray mouse lemur and all other mouse lemurs are considered cryptic species, as they are nearly indistinguishable from each other by appearance. For this reason, the gray mouse lemur was considered the only mouse lemur species for decades until more recent studies began to distinguish between the species.Like all mouse lemurs, this species is nocturnal and arboreal. It is very active, and though it forages alone, groups of males and females form sleeping groups and share tree holes during the day. It exhibits a form of dormancy called torpor during the cool, dry winter months, and in some cases undergoes seasonal torpor (or hibernation), which is unusual for primates. The gray mouse lemur can be found in several types of forest throughout western and southern Madagascar. Its diet consists primarily of fruit, insects, flowers, and nectar. In the wild, its natural predators include owls, snakes, and endemic mammalian predators. Predation pressure is higher for this species than among any other primate species, with one out of four individuals taken by a predator each year. This is counterbalanced by its high reproductive rate. Breeding is seasonal, and distinct vocalizations are used to prevent hybridization with species that overlap its range. Gestation lasts approximately 60\u00a0days, and typically two young are born. The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year. The gray mouse lemur has a reproductive lifespan of five years, although captive individuals have been reported to live up to 15\u00a0years.Although threatened by deforestation, habitat degradation, and live capture for the pet trade, it is considered one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals. It can tolerate moderate food shortages by experiencing daily torpor to conserve energy, but extended food shortages due to climate change may pose a significant risk to the species."}]}

Adults and their young will stay within 2\u20133 metres of each other throughout the night. The family groups are generally made up of about 4 individuals, although group sizes of 2 to 10 individuals have been reported. The possum spends most of its time sheltered within rock piles or crevices. After dark it moves from its rocky home into the nearby trees where it feeds. This possum is secretive, difficult to trap and avoids contact and confrontation as far as possible. It is primarily terrestrial, moving into the trees only to feed. This distinguishes it from its close, mostly arboreal relatives. Its eye-shine is very bright in a spotlight but unlike most possums, it doesn't freeze when caught in a bean of light. Instead, it retreats to its rock shelter or crevices where it hides with its head in the crevice but its body exposed. ReproductionThere appears to be no particular season for breeding. However, females with a large young in the pouch and a young on the back have been seen in March, July, August and September. Although the gestation period information is not available for the species, it is known that close relatives have gestation periods from 16 to 30 days. The new offspring spends its first five weeks in the female's large pouch which has two teats. The parents usually carry the new offspring on their back after they have left the mother's pouch. Caring for the young is divided nearly equally among the parents. The parents are assisted in raising the offspring by the previous offspring who commonly stay with the family unit. The parents practice protective behaviours such as spend time watching for predators, tail beating, and vocalizing and marshaling the young to keep them relatively close. Home range and obligate monogamyBoth sexes have about the same home range size. Average home range is 0.9 hectares, with home ranges ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.2 hectares. The average density in these home ranges is 0.4 possums per hectare. Females live with one male in their home range, which are commonly marked by scent posts. To scent-mark, the rock-haunting ringtail possum rubs or presses their cloacal-caudal region or chest against the surface. While the possum also marked rock ledges and trees within its home ranges, scent marking was most vigorous around den sites.The rock-haunting ringtail possum is one of few obligate monogamous marsupial species. A consistent characteristic of obligate monogamy displayed by this species is the existence of cohesive and persistent pair bonds with mutual or asymmetrical attraction between adults. Both sexes of this species maintain strong pair bonds, as shown by the wide array of maintenance behaviours, which is a measure of bond 'strength'. However, males maintained the pair bond at a higher rate than females. Both sexes shared the decision-making process in terms of changing group activity.Presence of long-lasting bonds between parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed between parents and young were the embrace by adult males and the bridge formation. Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing is a way for the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles. CommunicationThe rock-haunting ringtail possum mostly uses scent to communicate. Adult possums have a distinct gland on the chest and males have a paracloacal gland which is about 2\u00a0cm in diameter. The possum maintains scent posts that are visited commonly. The rock-haunting ringtail possum uses both urine and faeces to mark these areas. This poossum is also thought to mark tree branches using its paracloacal gland. The rock-haunting ringtail possum has been observed striking its tail against rocks, possibly as a form of communication. The species also is able to make quiet screeches and grunts that serve as auditory communication."}, {"description": "The rock-haunting ringtail possum disperses seeds through its fruit eating habits. It also influences termite populations and acts as prey for regional predators. The rock-haunting ringtail possum has been affected by human induced habitat fragmentation and hence, its numbers have decreased significantly. The species is listed as a priority species in Western Australia. HabitatThe rock-haunting ringtail possum lives exclusively in rocky outcrops and prefers areas with large boulders and deeply fissured rock. It uses the crevices to hide by just sticking its head into the crevice with the body exposed. It is strictly nocturnal; it only moves out of it sheltered rock crevices to climbing trees to feed at night. It does not make a nest and has been observed occasionally to be sleeping in well protected rock ledges during the day. This suggests a high level of adaptation to a terrestrial existence. Indicators of a reduction in arboreal adaptation are shorter legs, shorter claws, shorter tail and a slightly longer snout. DietThe rock-haunting ringtail possum eats fruits, flowers and leaves of a variety of trees found near its habitat and occasionally feeds on termites. It usually stays close to the rocks while feeding but has been found as far as 100m from the nearest outcrop. Most common of the blossoms it eats are of Darwin Woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata) and Darwin Stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta). Its major fruit intake is from Zyziphus oenoplia, Vitex glabrata, Billy Goat Plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana), and Owenia vernicosa. Leaves eaten include Flagelleria indica, Pouteria sericea and Vine Reedcane. Known predatorsSome known predators of the rock-haunting ringtail possum are the Dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the Oenpelli Python (Morelia oenpelliensis), the Olive Python (Liasis olivaceous), quolls (Dasyurus spp.), owls (Strigiformes), feral cats (Felis catus), domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and humans (Homo sapiens). The rock-haunting ringtail possum spends a large amount of time participating in sentinel behaviour to avoid predators. It perches on branches or ledges and scans the area for danger. In an attempt to deter predators and to warn others, this possum beats its tail against tree branches vigorously causing the entire tree to shake."}, {"description": "The rock-haunting ringtail possum is almost the size of a small rabbit.

Meerkats are immune to certain types of venom, including the very strong venom of the scorpions of the Kalahari Desert, unlike humans.David Attenborough, 2000. Meerkats UnitedMeerkats forage in a group with one \"sentry\" on guard watching for predators while the others search for food. Sentry duty is usually approximately an hour long. A meerkat can dig through a quantity of sand equal to its own weight in just seconds. Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until they are about 1 month old, and do so by following an older member of the group who acts as the pup's tutor. The meerkat standing guard makes peeping sounds when all is well."}, {"description": "Meerkats are small burrowing animals, living in large underground networks with multiple entrances which they leave only during the day, except to avoid the heat of the afternoon. They are very social, living in colonies. Animals in the same group groom each other regularly. The alpha pair often scent-mark subordinates of the group to express their authority. There may be up to 30 meerkats in a group.To look out for predators, one or more meerkats stand sentry, to warn others of approaching dangers. When a predator is spotted, the meerkat performing as sentry gives a warning bark or whistle, and other members of the group will run and hide in one of the many holes they have spread across their territory.Meerkats also babysit the young in the group. Females that have never produced offspring of their own often lactate to feed the alpha pair's young. They also protect the young from threats, often endangering their own lives. On warning of danger, the babysitter takes the young underground to safety and is prepared to defend them if the danger follows.Meerkats are also known to share their burrow with the Yellow Mongoose and ground squirrel.Like many species, meerkat young learn by observing and mimicking adult behaviour, though adults also engage in active instruction. For example, meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat a venomous scorpion: they will remove the stinger and help the pup learn how to handle the creature.Despite this altruistic behaviour, meerkats sometimes kill young members of their group. Subordinate meerkats have been seen killing the offspring of more senior members in order to improve their own offspring's position. VocalizationMeerkat calls may carry specific meanings, with particular calls indicating the type of predator and the urgency of the situation. In addition to alarm calls, meerkats also make panic calls, recruitment calls, and moving calls. They chirrup, trill, growl, or bark, depending on the circumstances. Meerkats make different alarm calls depending upon whether they see an aerial or a terrestrial predator. Moreover, acoustic characteristics of the call will change with the urgency of the potential predatory episode. Therefore, six different predatory alarm calls with six different meanings have been identified: aerial predator with low, medium, and high urgency; and terrestrial predator with low, medium, and high urgency. Meerkats respond differently after hearing a terrestrial predator alarm call than after hearing an aerial predator alarm call. For example, upon hearing a high-urgency terrestrial predator alarm call, meerkats are most likely to seek shelter and scan the area. On the other hand, upon hearing a high-urgency aerial predator alarm call, meerkats are most likely to crouch down. On many occasions under these circumstances, they also look towards the sky."}, {"description": "The meerkat is a small diurnal herpestid (mongoose) weighing on average about 0.5 to. Its long slender body and limbs give it a body length of 35 to and an added tail length of around 25 cm. The meerkat uses its tail to balance when standing upright, as well as for signaling. Its face tapers, coming to a point at the nose, which is brown. The eyes always have black patches around them, and they have small black crescent-shaped ears. Like cats, meerkats have binocular vision, their eyes being on the front of their faces. Meerkats have claws used for digging burrows and digging for prey.At the end of each of a meerkat's \"fingers\" is a claw used for digging burrows and digging for prey. Claws are also used with muscular hindlegs to help climb trees. Meerkats have four toes on each foot and long slender limbs. The coat is usually peppered gray, tan, or brown with silver. They have short parallel stripes across their backs, extending from the base of the tail to the shoulders. The patterns of stripes are unique to each meerkat. The underside of the meerkat has no markings, but the belly has a patch which is only sparsely covered with hair and shows the black skin underneath. The meerkat uses this area to absorb heat while standing on its rear legs, usually early in the morning after cold desert nights."}, {"description": "The meerkat or suricate (Suricata suricatta) is a small carnivoran belonging to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). It is the only member of the genus Suricata. Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a \"mob\", \"gang\" or \"clan\". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12\u201314 years, and about half this in the wild."}]}

Tail length ranges between 202 and 345\u00a0mm.Northern quolls feed primarily on invertebrates, but also consume fleshy fruit (particularly figs), and a wide range of vertebrates, including small mammals, birds, lizards, snakes, and frogs. They also scavenge on road-kills, around campsites, and in garbage tins.A remarkable feature of this species is that the males show complete die-off after mating, leaving the females to raise the young alone. Females have eight teats in a pouch, but apparently give birth to more than eight young which must wriggle their way to the pouch and compete for a teat to survive. In a study in Western Australia's Kimberley region, the testosterone levels of males peaked in July, and females gave birth in July or August.In the wild, males live for about one year, while the maximum recorded for a wild female was about three years of age. In rocky habitats, the lifespan of both sexes appears to be increased to two or three years, and individuals are larger than those living in savanna habitats, possibly due to better habitat and reduced predation."}, {"description": "The northern quoll is now absent from many parts of its former range. It has recently been listed as Endangered under Australian Commonwealth legislation (EPBC Act), although it is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. Its current major threat is the spread of cane toads, which were originally introduced in Queensland, but have now occupied the Top End of the Northern Territory, including Kakadu National Park and the Darwin area, and entered the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where they are established around Kununurra and Lake Argyle.Other threats are predation by feral cats and foxes, and the destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of the quoll's habitat due to changed fire regimens, mining, land clearing, pasture improvement, and grazing. Quolls are also susceptible to being run over on roads.In two Kakadu study sites, quolls have become extinct at one site and declined from 45 individuals to five at the other site. The northern quoll may cease to exist in most areas in the Top End once the cane toad population completely overlaps the northern quoll's range. Remnant populations of northern quolls still persist in Queensland where cane toads have been present for many years. Scientists do not yet understand the mechanism for their persistence.The increasing spread of the cane toad throughout Australia is becoming a significant factor in the dramatic decline in numbers for the northern quoll. Like many native Australian species, northern quolls become poisoned after eating cane toads.To help protect northern quolls against cane toads, a University of Sydney project, revealed in 2010, is teaching them to avoid eating the invasive amphibians through taste aversion."}, {"description": "The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), also known as the northern native cat, the satanellus, the North Australian native cat or the njanmak (in the indigenous Mayali language), is a carnivorous marsupial native to Australia."}]}

It is found in the southeastern United States on sandy beaches, in corn and cotton fields, and in hedge rows and open timber tracts. Coloration varies with geographic location: inland populations are generally fawn-colored while coastal populations are lighter or white. The mouse eats seeds, fruits, and occasionally insects, and lives and raises its three to four young in a simple burrow. Weaning occurs at 20\u201325 days, and females may mate at 30 days of age. Predators are those that prey on small mammals. One individual lived in captivity for about five years.

DietP. polionotus are omnivores and the principal diet is seasonal seeds of wild grasses and forbs but blackberries, acorns, and wild pea may be consumed. Insects consumed include beetles, leaf hoppers, true bugs, and ants. Vertebrates are consumed. Beach populations will consume the fruits and wind-deposited seeds of sea oats and sea rocket and will feed on invertebrates when seeds are scarce.Wooten ShelterThe beach mouse burrows and leaves mounds of earth around the burrow entrance. The burrow slopes down from the entrance for a space then levels off with a nest at its end. A branch of the burrow may extend above the nest to just a few centimeters below the surface as an emergency exit. Should the burrow be disturbed, the mouse will \"explode\" through the sand via the exit and dash off. The mice will close any burrows in heavy rains should flood threaten. Spiders, snakes, and other species may move into a burrow.Whitaker 1998, p. 308\u20139 ReproductionThe mice are monogamous. Gestation is 23\u201324 days, possibly 25\u201331 if the mother is still lactating from a previous litter. Mean litter size is 3\u20134. When birth is imminent, the female assumes a crouching position and may rise to a more erect position as each juvenile is born. She may aid the birth by gently pulling on the young with her forefeet, as one mouse has been observed doing. The placenta may be removed in the same manner. She then eats it. The umbilical cord is broken by pulling or chewing or when the placenta is consumed. She may stretch and groom between deliveries. Births usually occur in the daytime and usually over several minutes or even an hour. The pinkish newborn may be washed by the mother following the last delivery and weigh between 1.1 -. The pinnae elevate in 3\u20135 days, the lower incisors erupt in 6\u20137 days, and the eyes open in 10\u201316 days. Weaning is gradual and occurs over 20\u201325 days. First estrus may occur as early as one month and first litter at 53 days of age. The juvenile pelage is gray. At one week, the young weigh 4 g, at three weeks 6 -, and at five weeks 8 -.

The name \"aardvark\" (;) comes from earlier Afrikaans (erdvark) and means \"earth pig\" or \"ground pig\" (aarde earth/ground, vark pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name groundhog). The name Orycteropus means burrowing foot, and the name afer refers to Africa. The name of the aardvarks's order, Tubulidentata comes from the tubule style teeth.The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata, in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus Orycteropus, the sole surviving genus in the family Orycteropodidae. The aardvark is not closely related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance. The similarities are based on convergent evolution. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, along with the sirenians, hyraxes, elephants, and tenrecs. With their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder Afrotheria. Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with Condylarthra.Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in Africa around the end of the Paleocene. The mysterious Pleistocene Plesiorycteropus from Madagascar was, when first described, originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the Eocene: too many subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that Plesiorycteropus is a relative of the golden mole and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark-like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution. The first known tubulidentate was probably Myorycteropus africanus from Kenyan Miocene deposits. The earliest example from the Orycteropus genus was the Orycteropus mauritanicus found in Algeria in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally aged version found in Kenya. Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout Europe and the Near East. A close relative lived in Madagascar during the last ice age.

Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission. Also, some tribes, such as the Margbetu, Ayanda, and Logo, will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms.

They hide in dark underground burrows to avoid the warm weather. The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table interferes with digging. They have been documented as high as 3200 m in Ethiopia. They are known to live throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions. These exceptions are coastal areas of Namibia, Ivory Coast, and Ghana. They are also not present in Madagascar. They avoid rocky terrain as it causes problems with digging."}, {"description": "Aardvarks live for up to 23\u00a0years in captivity.Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, hyenas, and pythons. The aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons. Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet. They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker. They will also dig to escape as they can, when pressed, dig extremely quickly. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent. FeedingThe aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (formivore); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber. In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark. They avoid eating the African driver ant and red ants. Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to. While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5\u20138 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again. During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a \"V\" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue\u2014as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30 cm) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns 10 - long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract termites from Odontotermes, Microtermes, and Pseudacanthotermes genera.On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (2000-2400); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between 2 and per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as 30 km in a night. VocalizationThe aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance. It makes a bleating sound if frightened. When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear. MovementThe aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents. It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes, but otherwise moves fairly slowly.When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be 10 m away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes. Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main burrow is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 m. These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the African wild dog, ant-eating chat, Nycteris thebaica and warthogs. Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season. Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature. If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, which also serves as protection from its predators. Reproduction Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a gestation period of seven months, one cub weighing around 1.7 - is born during May\u2013July. When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles. When nursing, it will nurse off each teat in succession. After two weeks, the folds of skin disappear and after three, the ears can be held upright. After 5\u20136 weeks, body hair starts growing. It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, and is eating termites at 9\u00a0weeks and is weaned by 16\u00a0weeks. By three months of age the young has been weaned. At six months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season, and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age."}, {"description": "The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade, it appears at time to be plantigrade. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.An aardvark's weight is typically between 60 and(-). An aardvark's length is usually between 105 and(-), and can reach lengths of 2.2 m when its tail (which can be up to 70 cm) is taken into account. It is 60 cm tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about 100 cm. It is the largest member of the proposed clade Afroinsectiphilia. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair. The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs. The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers. HeadThe greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of: These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten nasal conchae, more than any other placental mammal. The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair. The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles. The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions, but it is uncertain if it is olfactory or vibration in nature. Its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5. With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium, which is the location of the olfactory bulb. The nose contains nine olfactory bulbs, more than any other mammal. Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its olfactory lobe is very developed. The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on ants and termites. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as 30 cm long) and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell. The ears, which are very effective, are disproportionately long, about 20 - long. The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of rods. Digestive systemThe aardvark's stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard, (it grinds the food up) to make chewing not important. Its cecum is large. Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland. Its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness. The female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region.Genetically speaking, the aardvark is a living fossil, as its chromosomes are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa."}, {"description": "Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers, however, this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen. There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as least concern. However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.Aardvarks handle captivity well.

A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs.

AWRC.orgPerhaps surprisingly for such a widespread and successful species, the Virginia opossum has one of the lowest encephalization quotients of any marsupial. Its brain is one-fifth the size of a raccoon's. Tracks Virginia opossum tracks generally show five finger-like toes in both the fore and hind prints.Krause, William J.; Krause, Winifred A. (2006).The Opossum: Its Amazing Story. Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. 80 pages. The hind tracks are unusual and distinctive due to the opossum's opposable thumb, which generally prints at an angle of 90\u00b0 or greater to the other fingers (sometimes near 180\u00b0). Individual adult tracks generally measure 1.9 in long by 2.0\u00a0in wide (4.8 \u00d7 5.1\u00a0cm) for the fore prints and 2.5 in long by 2.3 in wide (6.4 \u00d7 5.7\u00a0cm) for the hind prints. Opossums have claws on all fingers fore and hind except on the two thumbs (in the photograph, claw marks show as small holes just beyond the tip of each finger); these generally show in the tracks. In a soft medium, such as the mud in this photograph, the foot pads clearly show (these are the deep, darker areas where the fingers and toes meet the rest of the hand or foot, which have been filled with plant debris by wind due to the advanced age of the tracks).The tracks in the photograph were made while the opossum was walking with its typical pacing gait. The four aligned toes on the hind print show the approximate direction of travel.In a pacing gait, the limbs on one side of the body are moved simultaneously, just prior to moving both limbs on the other side of the body. This is illustrated in the pacing diagram, which explains why the left-fore and right-hind tracks are generally found together (and vice versa). However, if the opossum were not walking (but running, for example), the prints would fall in a different pattern. Other animals that generally employ a pacing gait are raccoons, bears, skunks, badgers, woodchucks, porcupines, and beavers.When pacing, the opossum's 'stride' generally measures from 7 to 10\u00a0in, or 18 to 25\u00a0cm (in the pacing diagram the stride is 8.5\u00a0in, where one grid square is equal to 1 in2). To determine the stride of a pacing gait, measure from the tip (just beyond the fingers or toes in the direction of travel, disregarding claw marks) of one set of fore/hind tracks to the tip of the next set. By taking careful stride and track-size measurements, one can usually determine what species of animal created a set of tracks, even when individual track details are vague or obscured. Behavior The Virginia opossum is noted for reacting to threats by feigning death. This is the genesis of the term \"playing possum\", which means pretending to be dead or injured with intent to deceive. In the case of the opossum, the reaction seems to be involuntary, and to be triggered by extreme fear. It should not be taken as an indication of docility, for under serious threat, an opossum will respond ferociously, hissing, screeching, and showing its teeth, but with enough stimulation, the opossum will enter a near coma, which can last up to four hours. It lies on its side, mouth and eyes open, tongue hanging out, emitting a green fluid from its anus whose putrid odor repels predators. Besides discouraging animals that eat live prey, playing possum also convinces some large animals that the opossum is no threat to their young.Opossums are omnivorous and eat a wide range of plants and animals such as fruits, insects, snakes, and other small animals. The Virginia opossum has been found to be very resistant to snake venom. Persimmons are one of the opossum's favorite foods during the autumn.Sparano, Vin T. 2000. The Complete outdoors encyclopedia.

Accessed May 7, 2007. Placing an injured opossum in a confined space with its healthy counterparts is inadvisable.The Virginia opossum does not hibernate, although it may remain sheltered during cold spells. ReproductionThe breeding season for the Virginia opossum can begin as early as December and continue through October with most young born between February and June. A female opossum may have one to three litters per year. During the mating season, the male attracts the female by making clicking sounds with his mouth. Like all female marsupials, the females reproductive system is bifid: with two lateral vaginae, uteri, and ovaries, and the small (comparable to a dime at birth) young are delivered through a birth canal known as the median vagina that forms shortly before birth. The male's penis is also bifid, with two heads, and as is common in American marsupials, the sperm pair up in the testes and only separate as they come close to the egg. It is common for 20 or 30 young to be born (and even as many as 50), but the female only has 13 teats, arranged in a circle with one in the center, so only the first 13 may survive. An average litter is eight or nine joeys, which will reside in their mother's pouch for about two-and-a-half months, before eventually climbing on her back. They leave their mother after about four or five months.http://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/opossum-reproduction-lifecycle/ Life span Opossums, like most marsupials, have unusually short lifespans for their size and metabolic rate.

Its scarlet red face is due to the lack of skin pigments and plentiful capillaries that run under its facial tissue."}, {"description": "The conservation status of this species was changed from near threatened to vulnerable in the 2008 World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List because the species has declined at least 30% over the past 30 years (three generations) due to hunting and habitat loss. This is considerably better than the 1994 assessment which found it to be endangered, followed by the 2003 assessment which found the specieks to be near threatened. Although the conservation status has improved, actual population numbers are on a decreasing trend. Since it only lives in white water flooded forests, it is very susceptible to human impact (i.e.: land acquisition for agriculture and/or pastures).Forest loss and hunting are the two most prominent threats to the bald uakari. Between 1980 and 1990 it was found that an average of 15.4 million hectares of tropical forests were destroyed each year and the Neotropics are facing forest loss in areas such as the southern and eastern parts of the Amazonia. In 1997, the Amazon Basin experienced the highest rate of forest destruction of the remaining tropical rainforests worldwide. Logging of hardwoods is a major contributor to overall destruction as large-scale logging disrupts the continuity of forest canopies. Canopy disruption and forest loss directly affect uakaris because of their arboreal lifestyle and adaptations for seed food consumption. Additionally, Cacajao calvus populations are located so close to the Amazon River that there is a higher risk of human hunting from canoes and such to use the primates as a food source or bait. Conservation organisations In 1999, the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforest, set forth by the World Bank, aimed to place a total of 350 million dollars from Germany, Britain, and other major industrialized communities into conservation programs for the Amazon. Conservation efforts have also been initiated by Wildlife Conservation Society representatives working in South America. The Amazon-Andes Conservation Program (AACP) was established in 2003 in order to protect a set of seven landscapes in the Amazon. These protected landscapes account for approximately three percent of the Amazon Basin. The Wildlife Conservation Society is planning on expanding to more landscapes in the near future. Along with the AACP, Brazil\u2019s national environment agency, the Instituto Brasileiro do Meioambiente e dos Recursos Naturis Renovaveis (IBAMA) is gaining help from the army to patrol the Amazon for acts of illegal logging, mining, and deforestation."}, {"description": "The arboreal bald uakari prefers to reside in seasonally flooded forests in the area of the Amazon River Basin, in the countries of Peru and Brazil. It is important that the uakari is arboreal (lives in the tree tops) because of the flooding of the forests and the water rising to great heights during the rainy season. During the dry season, it returns to the ground to look for seeds and other food material. A study of the diet of the uakari found it to consist of 67% seeds, 18% fruit, 6% flowers, 5% animal prey, and buds. Its powerful lower jaw forms a pseudodental comb, which allows the uakari to open the hard surfaces of unripe fruits and eat the nuts that most other primates would not be able to open. It will also eat insects that happen to cross its path, however it does not specifically pursue this type of food.The bald uakari can be found traveling up to 4.8 kilometers per day in multi-male/multi-female groups of 5 to 30 individuals, and even up to 100. It can be extrapolated from the general primate behavior of female philopatry that female uakaries are also philopatric. This means that males leave the natal group. The total size of the group's home range is between 500 and 600 hectares. This requires efficient territorial defense mechanisms. A few of these include specific vocalizations, wagging of the tail, and erection of the hair.The bright red facial skin is a sign of good health and allows for the determination of a healthy mate. The breeding season is between October and May. Its gestation period is approximately six months. Both sexes have a sternal gland, which might be involved in olfactory communication, especially during mating, when the female encourages the male to mate by releasing an attractive scent. The bald uakari lives approximately 30 years and has been known to live over 30 years in captivity.Due to the uakari's location, it is extremely common for these animals to contract malaria.

The father or older brothers will mate with younger females. These young females have the ability to carry sperm for up to 2 weeks until they are sexually mature (at 3-4 months) so that they can make a family of their own without the interference of another male who may kill the fathers pups.

Its habitat there is mainly semideserts and steppes. Soil on the steppes is sandy and is covered with grasses, herbs, and shrubs. The steppes have cool, dry winters and hot summers. The temperature can get up to 50 C, but the average temperature for most of the year is around 20 C.In the wild, these gerbils live in groups generally consisting of one parental pair, the most recent litter, and a few older pups. Only the dominant female will produce pups, but she will mate with multiple males while in estrus (heat). One group of gerbils generally ranges over 325 -.A group lives in a central burrow with 10\u201320 exits. Some deeper burrows with only one to three exits in their territory may exist. These deeper burrows are used to escape from predators when they are too far from the central burrow. A group's burrows often interconnect with other groups."}, {"description": "The first known mention of gerbils came in 1866, by Father Armand David, who sent \"yellow rats\" to the Museum of Natural History (Mus\u00e9e d'Histoire Naturelle) in Paris, from northern China. They were named Meriones unguiculatus by the scientist Milne-Edwards in 1867. This scientific name in a combination of Greek and modified Latin loosely translates as \"clawed warrior\" in English, partly stemming from the Greek warrior Meriones in Homer's Iliad, combined with 'unguiculate' meaning to have claws or nails.Gerbils only became popular pets after 1954, when 20 breeding pairs were brought to the United States from eastern Mongolia for scientific testing. Almost all pet gerbils today are descended from these 40. Gerbils were brought to the United Kingdom in 1964 from the United States."}, {"description": "Golden Agouti \u2014 All Mongolian Gerbils in the wild are Golden Agouti, also called Agouti. The hair shafts on the back are grey at the base, gold in the middle and tipped with black, making an even mix of golden brown with black ticking. The belly is creamy white. An Agouti gerbil has black eyes. Black \u2014 A Black gerbil is black both on its back and on its belly. It most often has a \"bib\" or white line running down its chin. It also may have some white on its paws. A Black gerbil has black eyes.Black gerbils are also known to have a white belly. Argente \u2014 An Argente gerbil is orange with a white belly.

Argente Cream \u2014 An Argente Cream gerbil is an Argente lightened by a Himalayan gene, c(h). It is light orange with a white belly and ruby eyes. The undercoat is grey like the Argente Gold, but diluted due to the c(h). Argente Fawn / Topaz \u2014 A Topaz gerbil is an Argente lightened by a gene called Chinchilla Medium, c(chm), formerly called Burmese, c(b). This color is lighter than an Argente Golden but darker than an Argente Cream, and it often has slightly darker points at the ears, nose and tail. It has ruby eyes. The undercoat is grey, but diluted due to the c(chm). Lilac \u2014 A Lilac gerbil is dark grey all over. It has ruby eyes. Dove \u2014 A Dove gerbil is a Lilac lightened by the Himalayan gene, c(h). It is a powdery light grey all over. It has ruby eyes. Sapphire \u2014 A Sapphire gerbil is a Lilac lightened by a gene called Chinchilla Medium, c(chm). This color is lighter than a Lilac but darker than a Dove. It has ruby eyes. Pink-eyed White \u2014 A Pink-eyed White gerbil is completely white with light ruby eyes. Burmese / Colourpoint Black \u2014 A Colourpoint black gerbil is an all over chocolate color. Around eight weeks or so, it will begin to develop darker points on the tail, nose, feet and tips of the ear. Often has a \"bib\" or white line running down the chin. It also may have some white on its paws. All Burmese gerbils have black eyes. Siamese / Light Colourpoint Black \u2014 A Siamese gerbil starts out a light mushroom color. Around eight weeks, it molts and the tail, nose, feet and tips of the ear go black. The main body color stays the same. A Siamese has black eyes. It also often has a \"bib\" or white line running down the chin. May also have some white on the paws.Younger Siamese gerbils can have lighter bands on their feet, but will fade on the back but may stay on the front. Their color is also described as \"Mushroom colorpoint\". Colorpoint Agouti \u2014 A Colorpoint Agouti has an off-white to grey base with a liberal amount of silvery-brownish ticking along the back. The belly is white and the eyes are black. Light Colorpoint Agouti \u2014 A Light Colorpoint Agouti has an off-white base with silvery-brownish ticking along the back. Its belly is white and its eyes are black. Grey Agouti \u2014 The hairs on the back of a Grey Agouti are dark grey with white in the middle, making an even salt-and-pepper look. They often have gold intermingled into the coat. The belly is white. Grey Agoutis have black eyes. Slate \u2014 A Slate gerbil is a greyish black color. Often has a \"bib\" or white line running down the chin. It may also have some white on the paws. A Slate has black eyes with a reddish reflective shine in bright light or flash, however this can also appear on Black gerbils with certain recessives i.e. c(chm). Ivory Cream \u2014 An Ivory Cream gerbil is creamy colored on its back with a light cream belly. It has ruby eyes. Ruby-Eyed White \u2014 A Ruby-Eyed White gerbil is white all over. It has ruby eyes. Also known as Red Eyed White. Dark Eyed Honey \u2014 A Dark Eyed Honey gerbil starts out with a bright orange back with a white belly and flanks. At 8 weeks it molts and a small amount of black ticking appears along its back. A Dark Eyed Honey has black eyes. Nutmeg \u2014 A Nutmeg gerbil starts out with a bright orange color over its entire body. At 8 weeks it molts and liberal black ticking appears along the back with a lesser amount on the belly, changing the color from an orangey-brown to almost pure black, depending on the extensiveness of the ticking. A Nutmeg gerbil has black eyes. Silver Nutmeg \u2014 A Silver Nutmeg gerbil's first coat is an ivory color. At 8 weeks the gerbil molts and the liberal greyish ticking appears along the back with a lesser amount on the belly. A Silver Nutmeg gerbil has black eyes. Red Eyed Honey / Yellow Fox \u2014 A Yellow Fox gerbil has a bright orange back with a white belly and flanks. It has ruby eyes. Saffron / Red Fox \u2014 A Red Fox is a bright orange color over its entire body, with the color lightening somewhat through the belly area. Often there is a \"bib\" or white line running down the chin. There may also be some white on the paws. A Red Fox has ruby eyes. Polar Fox \u2014 A Polar Fox starts out a creamy ivory color. At 8 weeks the gerbil molts and minimal greyish ticking appears along the back. The nails are clear. A Polar Fox has black eyes. Schimmel \u2014 A Schimmel gerbil starts out as an orange color. At eight weeks old it molts and the coat begins to lighten to a creamy white. The gerbil's body continues to lighten throughout its life until it can be left with a white body, while the tail, nose, feet and tips of the ears retain the orange. Schimmel gerbils have black eyes. A schimmel with ruby eyes is a Ruby Eyed Schimmel. Black Eyed White \u2014 A Black Eyed White gerbil is completely white with black eyes. Some have greyish ear tips and dark claws. Spotting - Dominant spotting can be in any coat variety and will lighten the fur around it. How the spotting will look depends on modifiers. Collared - A thick, unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly. Collar and blaze - A thick, unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly and an unbroken white blaze connecting the three spotting areas (neck, forehead and nose). Pied - The base coat color may be of any standard type except for white. There is a thick band of white around the neck and shoulder area to form a collar that is connected to a blazed down the forehead and face. The distinguishing feature are small spots on the rump and back area around the spinal area. These spots usually do not have clear edges. The gerbil may be 50% white before it is considered a mottled gerbil as long as the spotting pattern conforms to the standard, accepted pattern. Mottled - The coat color of the gerbil may be any standard coat color broken by small white patches accompanying a collar and blaze. The gerbil may be up to 75% white until it would be considered a variegated gerbil. Variegated - The variegated pattern is when any standard coat color is broken up by small white patches along with a collar and blaze. The difference between the variegated spotting form and the mottled spotting form is the amount of white. The variegated spotting is an extended form of mottling. There is more white on the back and rump, allowing less color to show through. This can form a 'dalmatian' pattern. Often the tail tuft and the end of the tail is white or lacking pigment. Extreme White - The extreme white pattern is associated with any standard color except for white. Here the coat color is 90% white and barely any of the base coat color, or any pigment, is remaining. There have been health concerns circulating about extreme white gerbils. Head tilts, lack of good balance, and repetitive running and circling has been reported in these gerbils. It has been found that these health concerns mostly affect gerbils with unpigmented (light pink/not very opaque) ears. There are other spotting \"types\". Any that don't conform to show standards are usually classed as patched.Note: Although some US gerbil owners call some coat varieties \"fox\" i.e. yellow fox, the fox gene is not in gerbils and this is therefore incorrect."}, {"description": "Meriones unguiculatus evolved on the semideserts and steppes of Mongolia. There, they developed long legs for jumping and running from predators, teeth to deal with hard seeds and plant matter, and water conservation techniques that allow them to survive in the arid climate, such as the ability to use dry food or stores of fat to generate metabolic water. Mongolian gerbils do not have many natural enemies due to the harsh climate. Most predators are birds of prey or snakes. Mongolian gerbils are diurnal, but return to their burrows for the coldest and hottest parts of the day."}, {"description": "Die Mongolische Rennmaus (Meriones unguiculatus) ist eine zu den Rennratten geh\u00f6rende Art der Rennm\u00e4use.

Die Paarung spielt sich gew\u00f6hnlich nachts ab. Das M\u00e4nnchen klopft w\u00e4hrend des Werbens mit den Hinterbeinen und begattet das Weibchen mehrmals. Nach einer Tragzeit von 29 bis 30\u00a0Tagen werden zwei bis elf Jungtiere geboren; im Schnitt sind es 6,4. Die Tragzeit in Gefangenschaft wird dagegen meist mit 24 bis 26\u00a0Tagen, jedoch auch mit 19 bis 21\u00a0Tagen angegeben. W\u00e4hrend dieser Zeit nimmt das Weibchen um 10 bis 30\u00a0Gramm zu. Die Wurfgr\u00f6\u00dfe betr\u00e4gt in Gefangenschaft ein bis zw\u00f6lf, meist vier bis sechs und im Schnitt f\u00fcnf Jungtiere. Zur Geschlechterverteilung bei der Geburt gibt es widerspr\u00fcchliche Angaben: So soll die Verteilung entweder ausgeglichen sein oder die m\u00e4nnlichen Tiere sollen \u00fcberwiegen. Die Jungtiere werden am Tag oder in der Nacht geboren und gew\u00f6hnlich verzehrt das Muttertier die Nachgeburt und eventuelle Totgeburten. Am Nestbau und an der Pflege der Jungtiere beteiligen sich sowohl das M\u00e4nnchen als auch das Weibchen.Die Weibchen der Mongolischen Rennmaus durchlaufen viele Sexualzyklen pro Jahr, deren L\u00e4nge vier bis sechs Tage betr\u00e4gt; im Schnitt sind es vier Tage. Vaginalabstriche lassen drei Zyklusphasen erkennen. Die Brunst dauert 12 bis 18\u00a0Stunden lang an und f\u00fchrt zu einem spontanen Eisprung. Direkt nach der Geburt sind die Weibchen wieder br\u00fcnstig. Zuvor jungfr\u00e4uliche, geschlechtsreife Weibchen sto\u00dfen innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Tagen nach der Begattung durchschnittlich 5,4\u00a0Eizellen aus; beim ersten Eisprung nach einer Geburt sind es durchschnittlich 5,6\u00a0Eizellen. Acht bis zw\u00f6lf Stunden nach der Begattung und etwa vier Stunden nach dem Eisprung dringen die Spermien in die Eizellen ein. Sie weisen eine sich fein verj\u00fcngende Spitze auf und scheinen beim Eindringen ihre Kopfkappe zu verlieren. Die erste Furchung der Eizellen ist 22 bis 24\u00a0Stunden sp\u00e4ter abgeschlossen, die zweite sch\u00e4tzungsweise mehr als 30\u00a0Stunden nach der ersten und weitere Furchungen treten in Abst\u00e4nden von 20 bis 24\u00a0Stunden auf. Sechs Tage nach der Paarung und 102\u00a0Stunden nach dem Eisprung befinden sich die Eizellen haupts\u00e4chlich als Blastozysten mit mehr als 30\u00a0Zellen in der Geb\u00e4rmutter. M\u00f6glicherweise verz\u00f6gert sich die Einnistung der Eizellen, wenn mehr als zwei Jungtiere ges\u00e4ugt werden. Auch auf die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Scheintr\u00e4chtigkeit von 13 bis 23\u00a0Tagen Dauer gibt es Hinweise. W\u00e4hrend die Fortpflanzungsf\u00e4higkeit der Weibchen letztlich endet, kann es noch nach der Geburt des letzten Wurfes zum Eisprung und zur Paarung kommen.Als Nesthocker kommt die Mongolische Rennmaus nackt und rosafarben mit verschlossenen Augen und Ohren zur Welt. Das Geburtsgewicht betr\u00e4gt 3\u00a0Gramm, am zehnten Tag wiegen die Jungtiere 7\u00a0Gramm, nach einem Monat 23\u00a0Gramm, nach zwei Monaten 40 bis 41\u00a0Gramm, nach drei Monaten 46\u00a0Gramm und nach f\u00fcnf Monaten 48 bis 60\u00a0Gramm. Im Fr\u00fchling geborene Tiere erreichen bis zum Herbst ein K\u00f6rpergewicht von 60 bis 70\u00a0Gramm und eine K\u00f6rperl\u00e4nge von 110 bis 120\u00a0Millimetern. \u00c4hnliche Ma\u00dfe erreichen im Sommer geborene Tiere bis zum Fr\u00fchling. Bis zu einem Alter von 20 bis 25\u00a0Tagen werden die Jungtiere ges\u00e4ugt. Das Geburtsgewicht in Gefangenschaft wird mit 2,5\u00a0Gramm angegeben. Vom 2. bis zum 5.\u00a0Tag nach der Geburt entfalten sich die Ohrmuscheln, die ersten Haare entwickeln sich am 6. oder 7.\u00a0Tag, der Durchbruch der Schneidez\u00e4hne erfolgt zwischen dem 10. und dem 16.\u00a0Tag und die Augen \u00f6ffnen sich zwischen dem 16. und dem 20.\u00a0Tag. Die Jungtiere nehmen ab dem 16.\u00a0Tag feste Nahrung zu sich, sie werden jedoch in Gefangenschaft noch bis zu einem Alter von 20 bis 30\u00a0Tagen und einem K\u00f6rpergewicht von 12 bis 18\u00a0Gramm ges\u00e4ugt. Dann k\u00f6nnen sie sich selbst\u00e4ndig von Samen ern\u00e4hren. Der Hodenabstieg erfolgt zwischen dem 28. und 45.\u00a0Tag und die Vagina \u00f6ffnet sich zwischen dem 40. und 76.\u00a0Tag. Weibchen werden nach 65 bis 85\u00a0Tagen geschlechtsreif, M\u00e4nnchen nach 70 bis 85\u00a0Tagen. In Gefangenschaft pflanzen sich die Weibchen gew\u00f6hnlich im Alter von 7 bis 20\u00a0Monaten fort, M\u00e4nnchen auch im Alter jenseits von 24\u00a0Monaten."}, {"description": "Karyotyp 2n = 44 NF = 78 Der doppelte Chromosomensatz der Mongolischen Rennmaus weist 44 Chromosomen auf. 22 Autosomen sind metazentrisch, 10 submetazentrisch und 10 akrozentrisch. Das X-Chromosom ist gro\u00df und submetazentrisch, das Y-Chromosom kleiner und ebenfalls submetazentrisch. Die Anzahl der Chromosomenarme betr\u00e4gt somit 78. Hinsichtlich des nukle\u00e4ren Chromatins der Zellen mehrerer Organe existiert ein Geschlechtsdimorphismus."}, {"description": "Die Krallen der Mongolischen Rennmaus sind vergleichsweise gro\u00df und dunkel gef\u00e4rbt. Ma\u00dfe und Proportionen Die Mongolische Rennmaus ist etwas kleiner als andere Rennm\u00e4use ihres Verbreitungsgebiets. Ihre Kopf-Rumpf-L\u00e4nge betr\u00e4gt meist 97 bis 132\u00a0Millimeter, die Schwanzl\u00e4nge 85 bis 110\u00a0Millimeter, die Hinterfu\u00dfl\u00e4nge 24 bis 32\u00a0Millimeter, die Ohrl\u00e4nge 13 bis 15\u00a0Millimeter und die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Sch\u00e4dell\u00e4nge 30 bis 36\u00a0Millimeter. Mit 70 bis 92\u00a0Prozent der L\u00e4nge ist der Schwanz etwas k\u00fcrzer als Kopf und Rumpf.Der Kopf ist kurz und breit mit schlanken, hervorstehenden Ohrmuscheln. Der Hals wirkt sehr kurz. Die Hinterbeine sind lang und gut ausgebildet, die Hinterpfoten sind jedoch nicht ausgesprochen verl\u00e4ngert. Die Krallen der Vorderpfoten sind dagegen deutlich vergr\u00f6\u00dfert und nehmen eine Mittelstellung zwischen denen der Indischen W\u00fcstenrennmaus und denen der anderen Rennratten ein.Hinsichtlich der K\u00f6rpergr\u00f6\u00dfe konnten in der Natur keine merklichen Unterschiede zwischen M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen festgestellt werden. So betrug das K\u00f6rpergewicht von 25\u00a0erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen in der Inneren Mongolei durchschnittlich etwa 60\u00a0Gramm und das von 11\u00a0Weibchen etwa 59\u00a0Gramm, wobei ein K\u00f6rpergewicht von weniger als 50\u00a0Gramm bei drei M\u00e4nnchen und keinem Weibchen vorkam. In Gefangenschaft sind M\u00e4nnchen dagegen durchschnittlich etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer als Weibchen. So wiegen M\u00e4nnchen gew\u00f6hnlich 80 bis 130\u00a0Gramm und Weibchen 70 bis 100\u00a0Gramm. Fell und Farbewildfarbenes Fell Das Fell der Mongolischen Rennmaus ist eher kurz und weniger weich als bei Rennratten \u00fcblich. Das Unterfell ist fein und wollig, das Oberfell etwas fester und l\u00e4nger. Die Haare der Ober- und Unterseite sind meist etwa zehn Millimeter lang.Von der Schnauze bis zum Schwanz ist das Fell der Oberseite gr\u00e4ulich-braun, r\u00f6tlich-braungelb oder ockerfarben-braungelb. An den K\u00f6rperseiten ist es blasser braungelb. Die einzelnen Haare sind ockerfarben-braungelb, an der Basis schiefergrau, teilweise mit schwarzen Spitzen. Dazwischen befinden sich auf dem R\u00fccken einige l\u00e4ngere, vollst\u00e4ndig schwarze Haare, die zu einer insgesamt etwas dunkleren F\u00e4rbung f\u00fchren.Um die Augen verl\u00e4uft ein undeutlicher, hellbrauner bis braungelblich-wei\u00dfer Ring. Diese F\u00e4rbung erstreckt sich nach hinten \u00fcber die Backen bis zum Ansatz der Ohrmuscheln. Kurze Haare derselben Farbe bedecken die vordere Au\u00dfenseite der Ohrmuscheln und l\u00e4ngere, wei\u00dfliche Haare die hintere Au\u00dfenseite. Die R\u00e4nder sind mit kurzen, ebenfalls wei\u00dflichen Haaren ges\u00e4umt. Abgesehen von einigen sehr kurzen, wei\u00dflichen bis braungelblichen Haaren nahe der Ohrspitze ist die Innenseite der Ohrmuscheln nahezu unbehaart. Die Augen sind schwarz und die 5 bis 40\u00a0Millimeter langen Schnurrhaare sind gemischt schwarz und wei\u00df gef\u00e4rbt.Die Unterlippe, das Kinn, der obere Teil der Kehle und die Innenseite der Vorderbeine sind reinwei\u00df bis zur Basis der Haare. In der oberen Mitte der Brust befindet sich manchmal eine blasse, braungelbliche F\u00e4rbung. Der Rest der Unterseite ist wei\u00df oder hellbraun und die Haare haben anders als bei anderen Rennratten in ihrem Verbreitungsgebiet eine graue Basis. Der \u00dcbergang zwischen dem Fell der K\u00f6rperseiten und dem der Unterseite ist gr\u00e4ulich und verschwommen.Die Haare des Schwanzes sind an der Wurzel weniger als 10\u00a0Millimeter und zur Spitze hin bis zu 20\u00a0Millimeter lang. Die hintere H\u00e4lfte weist oberseits einen Kamm l\u00e4ngerer Haare auf und an der Spitze befindet sich eine ausgepr\u00e4gte, schwarze Quaste. Der Schwanz wird als rundherum ockerfarben oder deutlich zweifarbig, oberseits dunkelgr\u00e4ulich und unterseits blassbraun, beschrieben. Anders als bei der Mittagsrennmaus befinden sich auf dem Schwanzr\u00fccken kurze, schwarze Haare.Die Sohlen der Hinterpfoten sind mit Ausnahme eines unbehaarten Flecks an der Ferse vollst\u00e4ndig mit sandig-grauen Haaren bedeckt. Ihre Oberseite ist blass-braungelblich gef\u00e4rbt. Anders als bei der Libyschen Rennmaus und Meriones chengi weisen die Hinterpfoten nahe dem Kn\u00f6chel keine unbehaarte Stelle auf. Die Krallen sind im Gegensatz zu denen der Mittagsrennmaus gr\u00e4ulich schwarz oder dunkelbraun. Sch\u00e4del und Gebiss Sch\u00e4del einer Mongolischen Rennmaus (ohne Unterkiefer und mit besch\u00e4digten Jochb\u00f6gen)Der Sch\u00e4del der Mongolischen Rennmaus \u00e4hnelt dem der Mittagsrennmaus, jedoch ist der Gesichtssch\u00e4del h\u00f6her und die Jochb\u00f6gen sind weiter gespreizt. Mit bis zu 36\u00a0Millimetern L\u00e4nge ist er k\u00fcrzer als der Sch\u00e4del der Afghanistan-Rennmaus und anders als bei dieser ist die Jochbogenplatte am hinteren Ende deutlich vom K\u00f6rper der Jochb\u00f6gen getrennt. Ihre gr\u00f6\u00dfte Breite \u00fcbertrifft gew\u00f6hnlich die gemeinsame, an den Zahnf\u00e4chern gemessene Breite der oberen Schneidez\u00e4hne. Die Knochenleisten \u00fcber den Augenh\u00f6hlen sind schwach ausgebildet und stehen leicht hervor. Die Nasenbeine sind schmal und etwas k\u00fcrzer als der Nasenfortsatz der Zwischenkieferbeine. Das Zwischenscheitelbein ist haupts\u00e4chlich oval geformt und die hintere Grenze ist nach hinten gew\u00f6lbt, jedoch bildet die vordere Grenze dort, wo sie die Scheitelbeine ber\u00fchrt, eher ein Dreieck mit Spitze nach vorne.Die Paukenblasen sind hinten aufgebl\u00e4ht und mit einer L\u00e4nge von etwa 31\u00a0Prozent der Sch\u00e4dell\u00e4nge gro\u00df, wenn auch kleiner und vorne weniger aufgebl\u00e4ht als bei der Mittagsrennmaus. Sie reichen nicht bis zur vorderen Au\u00dfenseite der Geh\u00f6rg\u00e4nge, ihre Gr\u00f6\u00dfe f\u00fchrt jedoch zu einer Verengung des Basioccipitale des Hinterhauptsbeins sowie zu einer Ann\u00e4herung ihrer Vorderenden zueinander bis auf einen Abstand von 1,5\u00a0Millimetern. Die \u00e4u\u00dferen Geh\u00f6rg\u00e4nge reichen nicht bis zu den Jochb\u00f6gen, anders als bei der Afghanistan-Rennmaus ist ihre untere Wand jedoch deutlich angeschwollen. Das Nebentrommelfell ist gr\u00f6\u00dfer als bei der Winogradow-Rennmaus und kleiner als bei der Afghanistan-Rennmaus, der Mittagsrennmaus und der Libyschen Rennmaus.Kennzeichnend f\u00fcr den Unterkiefer sind die vergleichsweise breiten aufsteigenden \u00c4ste, die kurzen Muskel- und Gelenkforts\u00e4tze und der lange Winkelfortsatz. Die Ansatzstellen der Kaumuskulatur sind somit gut ausgebildet. Die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Sch\u00e4dell\u00e4nge von f\u00fcnf Exemplaren aus Shaanxi und der Mongolei betrug 33,9 bis 35,8\u00a0Millimeter, die Basall\u00e4nge 29,2 bis 30,5\u00a0Millimeter, die Palatall\u00e4nge 17,5 bis 18,8\u00a0Millimeter, die zygomatische Breite 18,2 bis 19,6\u00a0Millimeter, die Mastoidbreite 18,5 bis 19,6\u00a0Millimeter, die Breite \u00fcber die Backenz\u00e4hne 6,8 bis 7,0\u00a0Millimeter, die L\u00e4nge der oberen Backenzahnreihe 4,3 bis 5,0\u00a0Millimeter und die L\u00e4nge der unteren Backenzahnreihe 4,6 bis 4,8\u00a0Millimeter. Das Gebiss weist wie das aller Rennratten in jeder Kieferh\u00e4lfte einen als Nagezahn ausgebildeten Schneidezahn und drei hochkronige, nicht nachwachsende Backenz\u00e4hne auf. Ein Zahnwechsel findet nicht statt. Die L\u00e4ngsfurche der oberen Schneidez\u00e4hne ist ausgepr\u00e4gt und liegt leicht seitw\u00e4rts der Mitte. Der erste Backenzahn weist drei Zahnleisten auf, die innen und au\u00dfen durch zwei Einbuchtungen voneinander getrennt sind, der zweite Backenzahn weist zwei Leisten auf und der dritte Backenzahn ist klein mit beinahe kreisf\u00f6rmiger Krone. K\u00f6rperskelett Die Wirbels\u00e4ule der Mongolischen Rennmaus besteht aus sieben Hals-, zw\u00f6lf Brust-, sieben Lenden-, vier Kreuz- und 20 bis 24\u00a0Schwanzwirbeln. Atlas und Axis der Halswirbels\u00e4ule sind sehr stark ausgebildet, die \u00fcbrigen f\u00fcnf Halswirbel mit ihren sehr kurzen, glatten K\u00f6rpern dagegen schw\u00e4cher. Der Atlas weist kr\u00e4ftige, nach hinten gerichtete Forts\u00e4tze und bauchseitig ein deutliches, spitzes Tuberculum ventrale auf. Am Axis ist der Dornfortsatz sehr ausgepr\u00e4gt. Nach hinten nimmt die L\u00e4nge der Querforts\u00e4tze der Halswirbel zu.Der Brustkorb ist gro\u00df, nach hinten weit ge\u00f6ffnet und wird unten durch sieben sternale sowie f\u00fcnf asternale Rippen begrenzt, von denen die letzten beiden als Fleischrippen ausgebildet sind. Das Brustbein weist vorne nur einen d\u00fcnnen Knorpelrand auf und bildet zur beweglichen Verbindung mit den Schl\u00fcsselbeinen und dem ersten Rippenpaar zwei weit ausladende, V-f\u00f6rmige Knochenplatten aus. Sein K\u00f6rper setzt sich aus vier Sternebrae zusammen. Das Schl\u00fcsselbein ist als vollst\u00e4ndig entwickeltes, etwa zehn Millimeter langes Kn\u00f6chelchen ausgebildet und das Schulterblatt weist eine besonders ausgepr\u00e4gte, im Gr\u00e4teneck endende Schultergr\u00e4te auf.Das H\u00fcftbeinloch des Beckens ist vergleichsweise weit. Das Wadenbein ist schlank, liegt leicht seitlich hinterm Schienbein und beide Knochen verschmelzen in der unteren H\u00e4lfte miteinander. Von den Fu\u00dfwurzelknochen ist das Fersenbein gut ausgebildet. Die erste Zehe der Vorderpfoten ist rudiment\u00e4r ausgebildet, die anderen vier Zehen sowie die f\u00fcnf Zehen der Hinterpfoten sind dagegen normal ausgebildet. Die zweite bis f\u00fcnfte Zehe setzen sich aus je drei Gliedern zusammen. Organe Die hervorstehenden Augen der Mongolischen Rennmaus liegen seitlich am Kopf. Ihre Netzhaut ist reich an St\u00e4bchen mit einem Zapfen-Anteil von nur 14 bis 20\u00a0Prozent und die Iris ist dunkel. Das Gehirn der M\u00e4nnchen wiegt etwa 1,02\u00a0Gramm, das der Weibchen etwa 1,18\u00a0Gramm. Der Riechkolben ist sehr gut entwickelt und ein Jacobson-Organ ist vorhanden. Vom R\u00fcckenmark zweigen 38\u00a0Nervenpaare ab: acht vom Halsmark, 13 vom Brustmark, sieben vom Lendenmark, drei vom Kreuzmark und sieben vom Schwanzmark.Die Luftr\u00f6hre verl\u00e4uft links von der Speiser\u00f6hre. Einige Knorpelspangen sind c-f\u00f6rmig und r\u00fcckenseitig nicht vollst\u00e4ndig geschlossen. Die Lunge wiegt etwa 400\u00a0Milligramm und der rechte Lungenfl\u00fcgel weist vier Lappen, der linke drei Lappen auf. Etwa 40\u00a0Prozent der Tiere weisen einen unvollst\u00e4ndigen Arterienring des Hirns auf. Das Herz wiegt etwa 420\u00a0Milligramm. Der Thymus bleibt bei erwachsenen Tieren bestehen und ist in zwei Lappen gegliedert, die vollst\u00e4ndig oder, bei Jungtieren, zu etwa zwei Dritteln im Brustkorb liegen. Die Milz wiegt etwa 130\u00a0Milligramm und liegt in der linken Rippenbogengegend.Die Schilddr\u00fcse ist zweilappig, gelblich und liegt seitlich sowie mittseits des Kehlkopfes. Die Nebenschilddr\u00fcsen liegen leicht seitlich vor den vorderen Schilddr\u00fcsenpolen. Die Nebennieren liegen mittseits vom vorderen Nierenpol und ihre Masse ist im Vergleich zum K\u00f6rpergewicht vergleichsweise hoch. So betr\u00e4gt das Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen ihrer Masse und dem K\u00f6rpergewicht das Drei- bis Vierfache von dem der Ratte. Die linke Nebenniere wiegt etwa 30\u00a0Milligramm, die rechte etwa 25\u00a0Milligramm. Die Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse besteht aus dem K\u00f6rper, einem rechten sowie einem linken Fl\u00fcgel und wiegt etwa 220\u00a0Milligramm. Die Leber besteht aus einem linken, einem rechten sowie einem Mittelteil und wiegt etwa 4,6\u00a0Gramm. Die Gallenblase ist bohnenf\u00f6rmig.Der Magen ist einh\u00f6hlig zusammengesetzt aus einer als Blindsack ausgebildeten, gro\u00dfen Vormagenabteilung sowie einer kleinen Dr\u00fcsenmagenabteilung und kann bei M\u00e4nnchen fast vollst\u00e4ndig in den Brustkorb verlagert sein. Der Zw\u00f6lffingerdarm besteht aus dem Anfangsteil, dem absteigenden sowie dem aufsteigenden Teil, der Leerdarm weist durchschnittlich sieben girlandenartige Schlingen auf und der Krummdarm ist sehr kurz. Der Blinddarm ist gro\u00df und hakenf\u00f6rmig, gliedert sich in Kopf, K\u00f6rper sowie Spitze und kann bei M\u00e4nnchen bis zum Brustkorb verlagert sein. Der Grimmdarm gliedert sich in den aufsteigenden, den querverlaufenden sowie den absteigenden Grimmdarm und der Mastdarm ist bei M\u00e4nnchen fast doppelt so lang wie bei Weibchen. Die Gesamtl\u00e4nge des Darms betr\u00e4gt etwa 54,5\u00a0Zentimeter.Die Nieren sind bohnenf\u00f6rmig, einwarzig-glatt und dunkelbraunrot. Sie sind etwa 13\u00a0Millimeter lang und 8\u00a0Millimeter breit, die linke Niere wiegt etwa 370\u00a0Milligramm, die rechte 360\u00a0Milligramm. Bis auf die Bauchfl\u00e4che sind sie von reichlich braunem Fettgewebe umgeben. Die Nierenpapillen sind sehr lang und das L\u00e4ngenverh\u00e4ltnis von Papillen sowie dem Nierenmark zur Nierenrinde ist doppelt so gro\u00df wie bei der Ratte. Die Henleschen Schleifen sind extrem lang. Die Harnleiter verlaufen parallel zur hinteren Hohlvene und m\u00fcnden r\u00fcckenseitig in die Harnblase. Diese ist gef\u00fcllt kugelf\u00f6rmig, misst im Durchmesser sieben bis acht Millimeter, ragt auch schwach gef\u00fcllt bis in die Bauchh\u00f6hle und ist von einem gro\u00dfen v-f\u00f6rmigen Fettpolster unterlegt. Die Harnr\u00f6hre verl\u00e4uft beim Weibchen bauchseits von Geb\u00e4rmutter, Geb\u00e4rmutterhals sowie Vagina und m\u00fcndet selbst\u00e4ndig auf einem kegelf\u00f6rmigen Vorsprung bauchseits der Vulva. Beim M\u00e4nnchen ist sie in ein etwa zehn Millimeter langes Beckenst\u00fcck und ein Penisst\u00fcck unterteilt.Die Hoden der M\u00e4nnchen sind eif\u00f6rmig, etwa 13\u00a0Millimeter lang, 9,5\u00a0Millimeter dick und wiegen etwa 575\u00a0Milligramm. Sie liegen vollst\u00e4ndig im Scheidenhautfortsatz, der vollumf\u00e4nglich vom Hodenhebermuskel umfasst wird. Das Funktionsgewebe ist sehr weich und ein Bindegewebsk\u00f6rper ist nicht sichtbar. Die Nebenhoden bestehen aus dem kr\u00e4ftigen Kopf, dem d\u00fcnnen K\u00f6rper als Verbindungsst\u00fcck sowie dem Schwanz, sind grau-gelblich und wiegen einschlie\u00dflich der anliegenden Fettpolster etwa 1330\u00a0Milligramm. Wei\u00dfes Fettgewebe umgibt den vorderen Hodenpol sowie Teile des Nebenhodens, reicht bis in die Bauchh\u00f6hle und f\u00fchrt bei geschlechtsreifen M\u00e4nnchen zu erheblichen Lagever\u00e4nderungen des Magen-Darm-Trakts nach vorne. Der Samenleiter ist etwa einen Millimeter dick, von einer starken, grauwei\u00dfen Fettschicht umgeben und es sind \u00e4u\u00dfere und innere Ampullendr\u00fcsen ausgebildet. Die Samenblasendr\u00fcse ist paarig ausgebildet, die Prostata besteht aus einem vorderen, einem hinteren sowie einem stark gegliederten Mittellappen und die Harnr\u00f6hrenzwiebeldr\u00fcse ist ebenfalls paarig ausgebildet. Der Penis weist eine auff\u00e4llige Knickung mit nach hinten gerichtetem Endabschnitt auf und seine Gesamtl\u00e4nge betr\u00e4gt etwa 22\u00a0Millimeter. Er ist vom fibroelastischen Typ und aus zwei Penis- und einem Harnr\u00f6hren-Schwellk\u00f6rper aufgebaut. Im hinteren Endabschnitt ist bauchseits der Harnr\u00f6hre ein f\u00fcnf bis sechs Millimeter langer Penisknochen eingelagert. Ein kleiner Fortsatz \u00fcberragt die Harnr\u00f6hre als Spitzenkappe um etwa einen Millimeter. Die Penisvorhaut ist etwa acht Millimeter lang und \u00fcberragt den Penis hinten um zwei bis drei Millimeter. Es sind keine oder zwei Vorhautdr\u00fcsen vorhanden. Der Abstand zwischen Vorhaut\u00f6ffnung und Anus betr\u00e4gt bei erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen etwa zw\u00f6lf Millimeter.Die Eierst\u00f6cke der Weibchen liegen im Bereich des f\u00fcnften bis sechsten Lendenwirbels, der linke Eierstock liegt etwas weiter hinten. Sie sind etwa reiskorngro\u00df und bohnenf\u00f6rmig, wiegen etwa acht bis neun Milligramm und sind etwa vier bis f\u00fcnf Millimeter lang. Die Eileiter sind stark geschl\u00e4ngelt und etwa 18\u00a0Millimeter lang. Die Geb\u00e4rmutter besteht aus zwei vorne liegenden H\u00f6rnern und dem hinten liegenden K\u00f6rper. Die H\u00f6rner sind gemessen bis zur Zweigabelung 16 bis 18\u00a0Millimeter lang mit einem etwas k\u00fcrzeren linken Horn bei erwachsenen Weibchen. Die beiden H\u00f6rner laufen getrennt nebeneinander her und m\u00fcnden in einen unpaaren Geb\u00e4rmutterhalsabschnitt. Der hintere Teil der Geb\u00e4rmutter erscheint \u00e4u\u00dferlich einheitlich und die L\u00e4nge von der Zweigabelung bis zur Vagina betr\u00e4gt etwa f\u00fcnf Millimeter. Der \u00e4u\u00dfere Muttermund ist von vier Schleimhautfalten begrenzt und die Vagina ist etwa 15\u00a0Millimeter lang. Der Abstand zwischen Vulva und Anus betr\u00e4gt bei erwachsenen Weibchen etwa f\u00fcnf Millimeter.Die Haut ist dunkel pigmentiert, die Schwanzhaut ist locker und die Haut weist keine Schwei\u00dfdr\u00fcsen auf. Das Milchdr\u00fcsengewebe der Weibchen kann sich bis \u00fcber beide Schultern und weit nach hinten in den Dammbereich ausdehnen. Es weist vier Dr\u00fcsenkomplexe mit je einem Zitzenpaar auf: je eins im Brust-, im Brust-Bauch-, im Bauch- und im Leistenbereich. Hinter dem Augapfel weist die Nickhaut eine Harder-Dr\u00fcse auf, deren Ausf\u00fchrungsg\u00e4nge sich vor und unterhalb der Nickhaut \u00f6ffnen. In der Bauchmitte befindet sich eine Ansammlung von 200 bis 300\u00a0holokrinen, mit Haarfollikeln verbundene, vergr\u00f6\u00dferte Talgdr\u00fcsen. Diese Bauchdr\u00fcse ist bei M\u00e4nnchen etwa 5 mal 25\u00a0Millimeter und bei Weibchen etwa 4 mal 15\u00a0Millimeter gro\u00df.Gro\u00dfe Fettpolster treten im Bindegewebe der Unterhaut, als Umh\u00fcllung der Organe und teilweise auch zwischen der Muskulatur auf. Sie bestehen aus braunem und wei\u00dfem Fettgewebe und sind bei M\u00e4nnchen st\u00e4rker ausgepr\u00e4gt als bei Weibchen."}, {"description": "Die Atemfrequenz der Mongolischen Rennmaus liegt bei 70 bis 120 und durchschnittlich 90\u00a0Z\u00fcgen pro Minute, die Herzfrequenz bei 260 bis 430 und durchschnittlich 360\u00a0Schl\u00e4gen pro Minute und die K\u00f6rpertemperatur bei etwa 36 bis 39 und durchschnittlich 38\u00a0Grad Celsius. Hinsichtlich der Umgebungstemperatur und der Luftfeuchtigkeit ist sie an eine gro\u00dfe Bandbreite angepasst. Die Indifferenztemperatur liegt zwischen 30 und 35\u00a0Grad Celsius. Bei Temperaturen dar\u00fcber scheint sie ernsthaft beeintr\u00e4chtigt zu sein. Sinne Der Gesichtssinn der Mongolischen Rennmaus ist an ihr Fluchtverhalten angepasst. Das Blickfeld der Augen betr\u00e4gt fast 360\u00a0Grad und die Gesichtsfelder \u00fcberschneiden sich nur wenig, so dass r\u00e4umliches Sehen kaum m\u00f6glich ist. Da nur wenige Zapfen vorhanden sind, ist die Farbwahrnehmung eingeschr\u00e4nkt, die zahlreichen St\u00e4bchen erm\u00f6glichen dagegen gutes Nachtsehen.Der Geh\u00f6rsinn ist auf Schall mit Frequenzen zwischen 0,1 und 60\u00a0Kilohertz, insbesondere zwischen 0,2 und 32\u00a0Kilohertz, ausgelegt. Mit einem H\u00f6hepunkt zwischen drei und f\u00fcnf Kilohertz ist sie wie andere w\u00fcstenbewohnende Nagetiere an tiefere Frequenzen als Maus und Ratte angepasst. Das sehr gute H\u00f6rverm\u00f6gen im Bereich zwischen einem und vier Kilohertz dient vermutlich der Wahrnehmung von Fressfeinden, da in diesem Bereich keine Laute ausgesto\u00dfen werden. Diese konzentrieren sich dagegen haupts\u00e4chlich zwischen vier und sechs Kilohertz sowie um zehn Kilohertz und um 15\u00a0Kilohertz.Der Geruchssinn ist sehr gut entwickelt und die Riechzellen der Riechschleimhaut sind zahlreich. F\u00fcr den Tastsinn und die Orientierung sind die Vibrissen an der Schnauze, \u00fcber den Augen, an den K\u00f6rper- und den Beinau\u00dfenseiten sowie Druckrezeptoren an den Pfoten verantwortlich. Nahrungs- und Wasserstoffwechsel Bei einer Nahrungsaufnahme von f\u00fcnf bis sieben Gramm je Tag setzt die Mongolische Rennmaus 1,5 bis 2,5\u00a0Gramm Kot ab. Die Bildung der Kotballen erfolgt in der ersten U-Schleife des aufsteigenden Teils des Grimmdarms. Au\u00dferdem wird Vitamin-B-haltiger Blinddarmkot ausgeschieden. Ein Schleimhautwulst am \u00dcbergang vom Magen zur Speiser\u00f6hre macht das Erbrechen unm\u00f6glich.Wenn Wasser frei verf\u00fcgbar ist, verbraucht sie etwa 0,039\u00a0Milliliter je Gramm K\u00f6rpergewicht und Tag. Sie kann Salzwasser mit einer Konzentration von 0,8\u00a0Mol Salz je Liter Wasser verwerten. Ohne frei verf\u00fcgbares Wasser \u00fcberlebt sie gut und stabilisiert sich nach einem Verlust von etwa 14\u00a0Prozent des K\u00f6rpergewichts. Im Vergleich zur Ratte, zum Hamster und zum Meerschweinchen nimmt das durchschnittliche Blutplasma-Volumen dabei nur leicht ab. Bei einer Wasseraufnahme von vier bis sieben Millilitern je Tag setzt sie drei bis vier Milliliter Urin ab. Vermutlich kommt dem Blinddarm eine besondere Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Regelung des Wasserhaushalts zu. Blut Das Blutvolumen der Mongolischen Rennmaus betr\u00e4gt durchschnittlich 7,76\u00a0Milliliter je 100\u00a0Gramm K\u00f6rpergewicht und das Blutplasmavolumen durchschnittlich 5,27\u00a0Milliliter je 100\u00a0Gramm K\u00f6rpergewicht. Bei erwachsenen Tieren liegt der H\u00e4matokritwert bei 43 bis 51\u00a0Prozent und die Menge des H\u00e4moglobins bei 10,7 bis 16,5\u00a0Gramm je Deziliter. Die Anzahl der roten Blutk\u00f6rperchen betr\u00e4gt sieben bis zehn Millionen je Mikroliter, die der wei\u00dfen Blutk\u00f6rperchen 3.200 bis 12.200 je Mikroliter und die der Blutpl\u00e4ttchen 400.000 bis 600.000 je Mikroliter. Das Differentialblutbild ergibt 1,3 bis 5,2\u00a0Prozent oder 3.000 bis 4.100 Neutrophile je Mikroliter, 0,07 bis 0,32\u00a0Prozent oder bis zu 4.000 Eosinophile je Mikroliter, 0,1 bis 0,28\u00a0Prozent oder bis zu 2.000 Basophile je Mikroliter, 0,03 bis 0,25\u00a0Prozent oder bis zu 9.000 Monozyten je Mikroliter sowie 5,1 bis 11,8\u00a0Prozent oder 32.000 bis 97.000 Lymphozyten je Mikroliter. Der Anteil der Retikulozyten betr\u00e4gt 2,0 bis 5,4\u00a0Prozent.Die Halbwertszeit der roten Blutk\u00f6rperchen ist kurz und liegt bei etwa zehn Tagen. Daher kommt es zur vermehrten Bildung von Retikulozyten und zur Polychromasie. Vor allem bis zur 20.\u00a0Lebenswoche kommt es zu einer hohen Anzahl roter Blutk\u00f6rperchen mit basophiler K\u00f6rnung, die bei unreifen roten Blutk\u00f6rperchen als Rest zytoplasmatischer Ribonukleins\u00e4ure auftritt. M\u00e4nnchen haben h\u00f6here H\u00e4matokrit- und H\u00e4moglobinwerte als Weibchen sowie eine h\u00f6here Gesamtzahl wei\u00dfer Blutk\u00f6rperchen und eine h\u00f6here Anzahl im Blut zirkulierender Lymphozyten.Je Deziliter Blutplasma sind 4,3 bis 12,5\u00a0Gramm Plasmaproteine gel\u00f6st, davon 1,2 bis 6,0\u00a0Gramm Globuline und 1,8 bis 5,5\u00a0Gramm Albumin. Die Konzentration von Glucose betr\u00e4gt 50 bis 135\u00a0Milligramm je Deziliter, die von Harnstoff 17 bis 32\u00a0Milligramm, von Kreatinin 0,64 bis 1,12\u00a0Milligramm, von Cholesterin 90 bis 151\u00a0Milligramm, von Bilirubin 1,3 bis 2,5\u00a0Milligramm und von Harns\u00e4ure 1,1 bis 2,8\u00a0Milligramm je Deziliter. Die Menge Natrium wird mit 143 bis 165\u00a0Millimol je Liter, die von Kalium mit 3,9 bis 9,3\u00a0Millimol je Liter, von Calcium mit 2 bis 2,5\u00a0Millimol je Liter oder mit 3,6 bis 6,0\u00a0Milligramm je Deziliter, von Chloriden mit etwa 105\u00a0Millimol je Liter und von Phosphor mit 3,7 bis 7,1\u00a0Milligramm je Deziliter angegeben.Die Plasmaproteine einschlie\u00dflich der Glykoproteine \u00e4ndern sich mit dem Alter der Tiere. Die Blutcholesterinwerte steigen nach der Aufnahme von Cholesterin schnell und langanhaltend an und auch bei einer Ern\u00e4hrung mit einem Fettanteil von nur vier bis sechs Prozent kommt es vor allem bei erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen zu einem hohen Cholesterinspiegel im Blut. Dr\u00fcsen F\u00fcr die Verstoffwechselung des Cholesterins ist dessen Umwandlung in Steroidhormone bei der Mongolischen Rennmaus wichtiger als bei der Ratte. Ebenso unterscheidet sich die weite Stoffwechselbandbreite der Nebenniere stark von der bei der Ratte. Sie ist reich an Lipiden, anders als bei den meisten S\u00e4ugetieren produziert sie jedoch nur geringe Mengen Corticosteron.Die Harder-Dr\u00fcse setzt durch den Lidschluss Sekret frei, das aus Protoporphyrinen, Fetts\u00e4uren und Pheromonen besteht. Dieses f\u00fchrt durch das Porphyrin zu einer Rotf\u00e4rbung der Tr\u00e4nen, wird \u00fcber den Tr\u00e4nen-Nasen-Gang zu den Nasenl\u00f6chern transportiert und zusammen mit dem Speichel beim Putzen \u00fcber den K\u00f6rper verteilt. Das Sekret erm\u00f6glicht die Regulierung der K\u00f6rpertemperatur. Es isoliert gegen K\u00e4lte und Feuchtigkeit und erh\u00f6ht durch Dunkelf\u00e4rbung die Lichtabsorption. Soll die K\u00f6rpertemperatur gesenkt werden, nimmt die Sekretion ab und der Anteil des Speichels zu, was zur K\u00fchlung durch Verdunstung f\u00fchrt.Das Sekret der Bauchdr\u00fcse ist gelb, moschusartig und besteht haupts\u00e4chlich aus Phenylessigs\u00e4ure. Die aus den Dr\u00fcsen vorstehenden, gefurchten und nach hinten gerichteten Haare erm\u00f6glichen die optimale Platzierung des Sekrets auf Objekten. Die Entwicklung der Bauchdr\u00fcse ist androgenabh\u00e4ngig und sie wird mit Beginn der Geschlechtsreife aktiv. Vor allem bei dominanten M\u00e4nnchen ist sie gut entwickelt, bei anderen M\u00e4nnchen sowie dominanten Weibchen ist sie ebenfalls aktiv und nur bei untergeordneten Weibchen mit verz\u00f6gerter Geschlechtsreife ist sie klein und inaktiv. Weibchen haben w\u00e4hrend Tr\u00e4chtigkeit und Milchabgabe eine vergr\u00f6\u00dferte Bauchdr\u00fcse. Kastration f\u00fchrt zur R\u00fcckbildung, die Verabreichung von Testosteron kehrt diesen Vorgang jedoch um. Die Dr\u00fcse kann bei M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen mit vorhandenen Geschlechtsdr\u00fcsen durch Serum-Gonadotropin tr\u00e4chtiger Weibchen stimuliert werden und spricht bei Weibchen vor der Geschlechtsreife auf Progesteron und Testosteron an."}, {"description": "Lebensraum Brandt-Steppenw\u00fchlmaus]] sowie deren Baue.Der Lebensraum der Mongolischen Rennmaus sind Steppen, Halbw\u00fcsten, W\u00fcsten und Grasl\u00e4nder. In Gebieten mit Tonb\u00f6den, auf Ackerland und an D\u00e4mmen ist sie h\u00e4ufig, in gebirgigem Gel\u00e4nde dagegen gar nicht anzutreffen. Ihr bevorzugter Lebensraum sind Halbw\u00fcsten mit Getreide-Salzkraut-Erbsenstrauch-Gesellschaften sowie mit Salpeterkraut bewachsene D\u00fcnen. Sie kann sich jedoch leicht an felsige Lebensr\u00e4ume anpassen sowie an verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig feuchte Gebiete, die mit der Schwertlilie Iris tenuifolia und Bocksdorn bewachsen sind. Von S\u00fcden nach Norden bevorzugt sie zunehmend leichte, trockene B\u00f6den sowie den menschlichen Siedlungsbereich. So kann sie im n\u00f6rdlichen Teil ihres Verbreitungsgebiets am besten beobachtet werden. Im Osten der Mongolei sind 36\u00a0Prozent der auf Geh\u00f6ften anzutreffenden Nagetiere Mongolische Rennm\u00e4use.Im Norden und Nordosten Chinas bewohnt sie Sandw\u00fcsten. In der Inneren Mongolei kommt sie in W\u00fcstensteppen und einer Vielzahl anderer Lebensr\u00e4ume vor. Sie bevorzugt als Weideland und zum Anbau von Kartoffeln genutzte Steppen mit Sandb\u00f6den und sp\u00e4rlichem, unterbrochenem Bewuchs aus Gras, Kr\u00e4utern sowie Str\u00e4uchern. Das Klima ist kontinental und halbtrocken mit kaltem und trockenem Winter sowie hei\u00dfem Sommer. Die j\u00e4hrlich etwa 300\u00a0Milliliter Niederschlag fallen haupts\u00e4chlich von Juni bis August als Regen und von Oktober bis April als Schnee, der 20\u00a0Tage am St\u00fcck liegen bleiben kann. Die Monatsmitteltemperatur betr\u00e4gt im Januar etwa minus 20\u00a0Grad und im Juli etwa plus 21\u00a0Grad Celsius, wobei Temperaturen von minus 40\u00a0Grad und plus 50\u00a0Grad Celsius erreicht werden k\u00f6nnen. Im Fr\u00fchling sind starke Winde h\u00e4ufig. Im Sommer kann der Bewuchs zeitweise haupts\u00e4chlich aus dem Sievers-Beifu\u00df bestehen.Im S\u00fcden der Mongolei bevorzugt die Mongolische Rennmaus sandige B\u00f6den nicht sonderlich und kommt auf eher festen B\u00f6den vor. Im Nordosten der Mongolei ist sie in Getreide-Steppen und auf mit Erbsenstrauch bewachsenen, kleinen Sandh\u00fcgeln anzutreffen sowie auf Salzb\u00f6den und in Salzs\u00fcmpfen, die mit Salzkraut bewachsen sind. Am zahlreichsten ist sie gew\u00f6hnlich auf Abfallhaufen am Rande von Gem\u00fcseg\u00e4rten. In der Altai-Gobi lebt sie in mit Getreide, Salzkraut sowie Bocksdorn bewachsenen Halbw\u00fcsten und ist in den Schluchten h\u00e4ufig. In der Trans-Altai-Gobi ist sie in den Oasen sowie in den mit dem Salpeterkraut Nitraria sibirica bewachsenen D\u00fcnen anzutreffen. Am zahlreichsten ist sie jedoch in den T\u00e4lern der Fl\u00fcsse, nahe Ackerland und menschlicher Siedlungen sowie ebenfalls in Abfallhaufen. Sie wurde in der flachen, kargen Steppe s\u00fcdlich des Tannu-ola-Gebirges beobachtet. Im Nordwesten der Mongolei meidet sie die sandigen Sicheld\u00fcnen, ist jedoch in den flachen Salzkraut-Ebenen recht zahlreich.In Tuwa lebt sie haupts\u00e4chlich auf Ackerland, auf den Ablagerungen von Sedimenten der h\u00f6heren Wermut-Getreide-Steppen sowie in den W\u00fcstensteppen und auf den vom Kleinbl\u00e4ttrigen Erbsenstrauch bewachsenen, \u00e4lteren Ablagerungen der niederen H\u00f6henlagen. In der Region um den Baikalsee fehlt sie in gemischten Graslandsteppen, in felsigen sowie in sumpfigen Gebieten. Sie kommt dort nahe menschlicher Siedlungen und h\u00e4ufiger in Wermut-Steppen, in Salzgebieten sowie auf Acker- und Weideland vor. Zudem bewohnt sie trockene Sandsteppen, die mit Kleinbl\u00e4ttrigem Erbsenstrauch sowie Wei\u00dfem Wermut bewachsen sind, und ist in Steppen mit leichten, lehmigen B\u00f6den sowie verschiedenartigem, gemischtem Getreide-Gras-Bewuchs anzutreffen. Dort kommt sie auf Ackerland mit Buchweizen-, Hirse- sowie Weizen-Anbau vor und ist auf den k\u00fcnstlichen Erdd\u00e4mmen von Eisenbahn, von Stra\u00dfen mit und ohne Deckschicht sowie von Anlagen zur Bew\u00e4sserung recht zahlreich. Sie gr\u00e4bt Baue in Abfallhaufen sowie Erdbaue und meidet unber\u00fchrte B\u00f6den. Populationsdichte Die Populationsdichte der Mongolischen Rennmaus ist abh\u00e4ngig von Bodenbedingungen, Niederschl\u00e4gen und der Schneedecke von Jahr zu Jahr sehr ver\u00e4nderlich und kann unter manchen Bedingungen au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich hoch sein. Einen Hinweis auf die Dichte in einem Gebiet gibt die Anzahl der Baue und ihrer Eing\u00e4nge.So wurde bei Xilin Hot im Osten der Inneren Mongolei ein Verh\u00e4ltnis von etwa 5:1 zwischen Eing\u00e4ngen und Tieren festgestellt. Auf Brachland nahe Kartoffelfeldern wurden im Juni 1984 bei einer Dichte von etwa 90\u00a0Tieren je Hektar 460 bis 470\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge gez\u00e4hlt, auf Kartoffelfeldern 356 bis 390\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar, auf sonstigem Brachland 240\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar, auf Weideland 236\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar sowie auf gemischtem Strauch-, Brach- und Ackerland 214 bis 252\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar. Die Dichte nahm im Verlauf des Sommers vermutlich noch zu. Dagegen betrug sie im Siziwang-Banner im Zentrum der Inneren Mongolei in Spitzenjahren nur etwa 30\u00a0Tiere je Hektar.In den flachen Salzkraut-Ebenen im Nordwesten der Mongolei wurden 50\u00a0bewohnte Baue je Hektar festgestellt und in der mongolischen Getreide-Erbsenstrauch-W\u00fcste im Mai 1944 eine durchschnittliche Anzahl von 42\u00a0Eing\u00e4ngen je Hektar, in D\u00fcnen-Gebieten eine Anzahl von 504\u00a0Eing\u00e4ngen je Hektar sowie in den D\u00fckern entlang von Stra\u00dfen eine Anzahl von 2800\u00a0Eing\u00e4ngen je Hektar. In Daurien wurden in \u00e4hnlichen D\u00fckern 740 bis 1420\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar und auf Sedimentablagerungen 2500\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar gez\u00e4hlt, in unber\u00fchrten B\u00f6den dagegen nur 30 bis 32\u00a0Eing\u00e4nge je Hektar. Andere Z\u00e4hlungen kamen in Daurien auf 32\u00a0Baue mit 760\u00a0Eing\u00e4ngen je Hektar bei einer zeitweise geringeren durchschnittlichen Dichte. In der Baikalregion wurden in Wermut-Steppen sechs Tiere je Hektar gez\u00e4hlt, in Salzgebieten bis zu 15\u00a0Tiere je Hektar und auf Acker- sowie Weideland bis zu 90\u00a0Tiere je Hektar. F\u00fcr Tuwa wurde von 70 bis 176\u00a0Tieren je Hektar berichtet, was jedoch \u00fcbertrieben sein k\u00f6nnte. Ern\u00e4hrung und Vorr\u00e4te Die Mongolische Rennmaus ist ein Pflanzenfresser und ihre Ern\u00e4hrung wird durch die Samen und den Gr\u00fcnteil vieler Pflanzen bestimmt. Im Sommer bevorzugt sie gr\u00fcne Pflanzenteile, insbesondere von Hanf, G\u00e4nsef\u00fc\u00dfen, Buchweizen, Melden und der Strauchmelde Atraphaxis scoparia, im Winter Samen und Fr\u00fcchte. Die Zusammensetzung der Nahrung ist von Region zu Region unterschiedlich.In den haupts\u00e4chlich mit Sievers-Beifu\u00df bewachsenen Steppen im Osten der Inneren Mongolei ern\u00e4hrt sie sich von dessen St\u00e4ngeln und Bl\u00e4ttern sowie vom Beifu\u00df Artemisia commutata, vom H\u00fcgel-Salzkraut, von der Gr\u00fcnen Borstenhirse und vom Strandroggen Leymus chinensis. Vermutlich ern\u00e4hrt sie sich auch von S\u00e4mlingen und Wurzeln. Auf dem Ackerland Dauriens und Tuwas werden haupts\u00e4chlich die Samen von Feldfr\u00fcchten verzehrt. Auf Brachland umfasst die Nahrung Getreide, Wermut sowie verschiedene G\u00e4nsefu\u00dfgew\u00e4chse, Korbbl\u00fctler und H\u00fclsenfr\u00fcchtler. Hafer wird gegen\u00fcber Weizen als Nahrung bevorzugt. Im S\u00fcdosten Dauriens werden als haupts\u00e4chliche Nahrung der Mannaklee Alhagi kirghisorum und der Wanzensame Corispermum duriuscula genannt, die in von der Brandt-Steppenw\u00fchlmaus aufgegebenen Gebieten wachsen. Mit Beginn der jahreszeitlichen Ver\u00e4nderung der Pflanzendecke beginnt sie sich von wildem Getreide zu ern\u00e4hren, ohne damit ihren Bedarf decken zu k\u00f6nnen.Als Wintervorrat werden die Samen verschiedener Pflanzen genutzt. So wurden in den Vorratskammern ihrer Baue die Samen von Buchweizen, Weizen, Hirse, Hafer, Borstenhirsen, G\u00e4nsef\u00fc\u00dfen, Erbsenstr\u00e4uchern sowie die Zweige von Wermut gefunden. Die Menge der Samen betrug bis zu 20,5\u00a0Kilogramm bei Buchweizen und bis zu 1,4\u00a0Kilogramm bei Erbsenstr\u00e4uchern. Im S\u00fcden Dauriens bestehen die Vorr\u00e4te teilweise aus den Sprossen von Wermut und Salzmelden sowie aus dem Behaarten Liebesgras. In der Inneren Mongolei enthielten ihre Vorratskammern die \u00c4hren von Leymus chinensis. Die von September bis M\u00e4rz gef\u00fcllten Vorratskammern sind von April bis August leer. Sie enthalten gew\u00f6hnlich nur eine Art Nahrung. Diese wird von Mitte August bis in den mittleren Herbst und manchmal bis in den Winter eingetragen, woran sich alle Tiere beteiligen. So k\u00f6nnen erwachsene Tiere bei der Nahrungssuche sehr h\u00e4ufig zusammen mit ihrem halbw\u00fcchsigen Nachwuchs beobachtet werden. W\u00e4hrend beim Eintragen hinsichtlich des Alters und Geschlechts kein Unterschied festgestellt werden konnte, gibt es teilweise erhebliche Unterschiede bei einzelnen Tieren. Konkurrenten und Fressfeinde Daurische Pfeifhase]].Zu den Nahrungskonkurrenten der Mongolischen Rennmaus geh\u00f6ren der Daurische Ziesel, der Daurische Pfeifhase und der Daurische Zwerghamster. Im Osten der Inneren Mongolei wird ihr Lebensraum als Weideland f\u00fcr Schafe, Rinder und Pferde genutzt.Ein wesentlicher Fressfeind ist der Uhu, in dessen Gew\u00f6lle sich \u00dcberreste der Mongolischen Rennmaus fanden. Steppeniltisse und Mauswiesel wurden dabei beobachtet, wie sie in den Bauen der Rennm\u00e4use verschwanden. Deren Aktivit\u00e4t nahm bei mehrt\u00e4giger Anwesenheit von Mauswieseln deutlich ab. Weitere m\u00f6gliche Fressfeinde sind das Altaiwiesel, der Rotfuchs, der Wolf, Hirtenhunde sowie der Hochlandbussard. Altersstruktur, Geschlechterverteilung und Lebenserwartung Von 126 im Juni 1984 im Osten der Inneren Mongolei gefangenen Tieren waren 19\u00a0Prozent Jungtiere, 54\u00a0Prozent halbw\u00fcchsige und 27\u00a0Prozent erwachsene Tiere. Vier Prozent waren wahrscheinlich mindestens acht oder neun Monate alt, wurden also sp\u00e4testens im Herbst des Vorjahres geboren. Von den Jungtieren waren 42\u00a0Prozent m\u00e4nnlich, von den halbw\u00fcchsigen 58\u00a0Prozent und von den fortpflanzungsf\u00e4higen Tieren 68\u00a0Prozent. Neun der elf gefangenen erwachsenen Weibchen waren entweder tr\u00e4chtig oder s\u00e4ugend und mindestens elf halbw\u00fcchsigen Weibchen sowie 29\u00a0halbw\u00fcchsigen M\u00e4nnchen stand die Fortpflanzungsf\u00e4higkeit unmittelbar bevor.Die durchschnittliche Lebenserwartung der Mongolischen Rennmaus betr\u00e4gt in der Natur vermutlich nicht mehr als drei bis vier Monate. Ein markiertes, erwachsenes Weibchen wurde nach fast einem Jahr ein zweites Mal gefangen, nachdem es seinen zweiten Winter verbracht hatte. So liegt die maximale Lebenserwartung in der Natur bei etwa zwei Jahren oder etwas dar\u00fcber und innerhalb eines Jahres ist eine Population gew\u00f6hnlich vollst\u00e4ndig erneuert. In Gefangenschaft betr\u00e4gt die Lebenserwartung dagegen gew\u00f6hnlich drei bis vier Jahre. Bau Der Bau der Mongolischen Rennmaus dient als Schutz vor extremen Temperaturen, Regen und Schnee, starken Winden sowie vor Fressfeinden.In trockenem Sand- oder Tonboden angelegt unterscheidet er sich je nach Landschaftsform. Er ist verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig einfach oder aufwendig strukturiert, gew\u00f6hnlich f\u00fcnf bis sechs Meter und bis zu 14\u00a0Meter lang. Die meist f\u00fcnf bis zehn Eing\u00e4nge \u00f6ffnen sich waagerecht oder schr\u00e4g zur Erdoberfl\u00e4che. Im zentralen Teil der Anlage liegen eine Nestkammer und ein oder zwei Vorratskammern. Die Nestkammer befindet sich im Sommerbau gew\u00f6hnlich in einer Tiefe von 40 bis 45\u00a0Zentimetern und im Winterbau in einer Tiefe von 110 bis 150\u00a0Zentimetern. Die mit 45 bis 60\u00a0Zentimetern meist nicht sehr tief liegenden G\u00e4nge messen etwa vier Zentimeter im Durchmesser. Das runde Nest ist gew\u00f6hnlich 15 bis 40\u00a0Zentimeter lang und 13 bis 20\u00a0Zentimeter breit. Nahe bebautem Land besteht es aus den Bl\u00e4ttern und Sprossen von Buchweizen und Hirse, sonst von S\u00fc\u00df- und Sauergr\u00e4sern, daneben aus Haaren und Federn sowie manchmal aus Abf\u00e4llen.Vor\u00fcbergehende Baue befinden sich in einem Umkreis von 10 bis 20\u00a0Metern um den eigentlichen Bau herum. Diese sind nicht l\u00e4nger als zwei bis vier Meter und weisen ein bis drei Eing\u00e4nge auf. Manchmal enthalten sie kleine Kammern, in denen Nahrungsreste gefunden werden k\u00f6nnen. H\u00e4ufig benutzt die Mongolische Rennmaus die Baue der Brandt-Steppenw\u00fchlmaus. Aktivit\u00e4t, Sozialit\u00e4t und Mobilit\u00e4t Die Mongolische Rennmaus ist tag- und nachtaktiv, im Winter jedoch haupts\u00e4chlich tagaktiv, und h\u00e4lt weder Winter- noch Sommerschlaf. Sie bevorzugt den fr\u00fchen Morgen und den fr\u00fchen Abend, ist jedoch selbst bei Temperaturen \u00fcber 38\u00a0Grad Celsius im Sommer und unter 0\u00a0Grad im Winter auf der Erdoberfl\u00e4che aktiv. W\u00e4hrend der hei\u00dfen Jahreszeit ist sie mittags nicht aktiv, im Fr\u00fchling sowie im Herbst ist sie in kalten N\u00e4chten ebenfalls inaktiv und im Winter erscheint sie nur an warmen Tagen auf der Erdoberfl\u00e4che. Wenn das Wetter kalt und windig ist, verl\u00e4sst sie den Bau nicht und ern\u00e4hrt sich von ihren Vorr\u00e4ten. Am aktivsten ist sie w\u00e4hrend der Fortpflanzungsperiode und beim Eintragen der Vorr\u00e4te.Sie lebt in Kolonien, bevorzugt in Familienverb\u00e4nden, die ihre Baue gemeinsam verteidigen. Im S\u00fcdosten Dauriens wurden im Sommer ein bis drei erwachsene M\u00e4nnchen, zwei bis sieben erwachsene Weibchen und insgesamt 3 bis 14\u00a0Tiere in einem Bau gefangen. Auch den Winter verbringen Familiengruppen bestehend aus Eltern und deren letztem Wurf im selben Bau. Wie die Gro\u00dfe Rennmaus lebt sie jedoch nicht ausschlie\u00dflich in kleinen Familiengruppen sondern in etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferen Gruppen, die aus mehreren erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen, Halbw\u00fcchsigen sowie Jungtieren verschiedener Generationen bestehen k\u00f6nnen. So suchen Tiere benachbarte Baue auf, die manchmal miteinander verbunden sind. Fremde Artgenossen werden dagegen verjagt, im Vergleich zu anderen Rennm\u00e4usen ist sie jedoch gesellig und \u00e4u\u00dferst duldsam gegen\u00fcber Artgenossen. Im November k\u00f6nnen h\u00e4ufig ihre Pfiffe geh\u00f6rt werden, die denen des Daurischen Pfeifhasen \u00e4hneln, jedoch etwas leiser und melodischer sind. Im Fr\u00fchling ist sie dagegen eher still. Gefahr signalisieren die Tiere einander durch das Trommeln mit den Hinterpfoten.Im Sommer legt die Mongolische Rennmaus t\u00e4glich Strecken von 1,2 bis 1,8\u00a0Kilometern zur\u00fcck. Dabei sind ihre Bewegungen nicht zielgerichtet und \u00fcberschreiten niemals die Grenzen ihres sich \u00fcber 700\u00a0Meter ausdehnenden Aktionsraums. Sie ist sehr mobil und die Best\u00e4nde verschiedener Baue vermischen sich im Sommer und Herbst sehr stark. So ergaben Untersuchungen markierter Tiere im S\u00fcdosten Dauriens bei erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen Schwankungen von 10 bis 32\u00a0Prozent im Bestand, bei erwachsenen Weibchen von 18 bis 52\u00a0Prozent und bei Jungtieren von 22 bis 28\u00a0Prozent. Zwischen M\u00e4rz und August betrug der Anteil der erstmals gefangenen Tiere in jedem Bau zwischen 72 und 89\u00a0Prozent. \u00dcber einen Zeitraum von 120\u00a0Tagen konnten in 43\u00a0Prozent der Baue ein bis sechs Tiere gefangen werden, in 44\u00a0Prozent der Baue 7 bis 16\u00a0Tiere und in 13\u00a0Prozent der Baue 17 bis 22\u00a0Tiere. Die meisten Tiere wurden in den gr\u00f6\u00dften Bauen oder in denen entlang der Wanderwege gefangen. Bei einem erwachsenen Weibchen dauerte die l\u00e4ngste Nutzung desselben Baus von Mai bis August, bei einem erwachsenen M\u00e4nnchen von M\u00e4rz bis Juni und bei einem weiblichen Jungtier 3,5\u00a0Monate. Wenn sich das Nahrungsangebot erheblich verschlechtert, kann es zu Wanderungen kommen. Dabei sind Entfernungen zwischen 15 und 20\u00a0Kilometern, entlang von Stra\u00dfen vereinzelt bis 40\u00a0Kilometern und in einem Fall von 50\u00a0Kilometern bekannt."}, {"description": "Regionale Bedeutung und Gef\u00e4hrdung Die Mongolische Rennmaus gilt als Sch\u00e4dling im Getreideanbau und ist ein nat\u00fcrlicher Wirt f\u00fcr Erreger von Zoonosen wie der Pest, des Schweinerotlaufs, der alveol\u00e4ren Echinokokkose und m\u00f6glicherweise der Schistosomiasis. Sie ist jedoch weitgehend frei von Endemien und Parasitosen.Die Weltnaturschutzunion IUCN stufte sie 2008 als nicht gef\u00e4hrdet (least concern) ein. Dies wird mit ihrer Populationsgr\u00f6\u00dfe und weiten Verbreitung begr\u00fcndet. Ein Populationsr\u00fcckgang konnte nicht festgestellt werden, sie ist eine h\u00e4ufige Art und kommt in zahlreichen Schutzgebieten vor. So liegen in der Mongolei etwa sechs Prozent ihres Verbreitungsgebiets in Schutzgebieten. Obwohl sie als Sch\u00e4dling bek\u00e4mpft und durch Fl\u00e4chenbr\u00e4nde und m\u00f6glicherweise Lebensraumzerst\u00f6rung durch das Grasen einer zunehmenden Zahl von Vieh beeintr\u00e4chtigt wird, sind keine wesentlichen, gro\u00dffl\u00e4chigen Gef\u00e4hrdungen bekannt. Jedoch werden weitere Untersuchungen der Populationsgr\u00f6\u00dfe und -entwicklung empfohlen. Geschichte und Umfang der Haltung Farbschl\u00e4ge]] der Mongolischen Rennmaus. Mongolische Rennmaus 1935 fing Kasuga\u00a0C. 20\u00a0Paare der Mongolischen Rennmaus im Amurbecken im Osten der Mongolei und sandte sie zur Untersuchung von Rickettsien ans Kitasato-Institut in Tokio. Aus diesem Bestand baute Nomura Michiko 1949 eine weitere Kolonie im Tokioter Zentrallabor f\u00fcr Versuchstiere auf. 1954 sandte sie elf Paare an die zur Produktion von Versuchstieren gegr\u00fcndete Tumblebrook Farm von Victor Schwentker in Brant Lake, New York, wo mit vier M\u00e4nnchen und f\u00fcnf Weibchen die Nachzucht gelang. Kurz darauf gelangten die ersten Exemplare in die Heimtierhaltung. In Europa begann die Haltung als Versuchstier in den 1960er Jahren. 1964 f\u00fchrte J.\u00a0H.\u00a0Marston zw\u00f6lf Paare aus Massachusetts nach Gro\u00dfbritannien ein und gr\u00fcndete eine Kolonie an der Universit\u00e4t von Birmingham. Weitere Exemplare wurden 1995 in der zentralen Mongolei gefangen und mit 60 von diesen gelang die Nachzucht.Die Mongolische Rennmaus ist die am h\u00e4ufigsten als Versuchs- und Heimtier gehaltene Rennmaus. So werden in den Vereinigten Staaten jedes Jahr etwa 100.000 Exemplare in der Forschung eingesetzt und 1996 wurden mehr als 760.000 Exemplare in knapp 280.000 Haushalten gehalten. Sie wird zudem als Futtertier gehalten. Es existieren verschiedene Farbschl\u00e4ge. In Nordamerika bestehen Bedenken, dass sich wilde Populationen etablieren k\u00f6nnen, die Ernten und B\u00f6schungen besch\u00e4digen und einheimische Nagetiere verdr\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnten. In Kalifornien ist die Einfuhr untersagt,Restricted species laws and regulations. Importation, transportation and possession of wild animals \u2013 Manual 671, Department of Fish and Game an den Highways existieren seit 1921 Kontrollstationen.California Vertebrate Pest Committee: Proceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference, Ausgabe 6, Wildlife and Fisheries Biology, University of California, Davis, 1974, S. 229 F\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Zwecke wurde 1963 eine Ausnahme geschaffen, die eine eigene Genehmigung erfordert.Animal Care Panel: Laboratory animal care, Band 18, Williams & Wilkins Co., 1968, S. 235 Bei Fishbourne auf der Isle of Wight wuchs ab 1973 eine Population auf einem Bauernhof innerhalb von drei Jahren auf \u00fcber 100\u00a0Tiere an und aus Gro\u00dfbritannien sind weitere kurzlebige Kolonien bekannt. Einsatz in der Forschung Die Mongolische Rennmaus wird in der Grundlagenforschung, der medizinischen, der physiologischen und der psychologischen Forschung genutzt. Ausgiebig wird sie bei der Erforschung des Alterns, des H\u00f6rens, von Zahnerkrankungen, von Hormonen, von Krebs, der Ern\u00e4hrung, der Wirkung von Strahlen, der Fortpflanzung, von Infektionskrankheiten und von Schlaganf\u00e4llen eingesetzt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen den Harn- und Geschlechtsapparat, das periphere und das zentrale Nervensystem.Sie ist als Modellorganismus zur Erforschung des menschlichen Geh\u00f6rs geeignet, da die Kurve der H\u00f6rempfindlichkeit der des Menschen bis zu einer Frequenz von zehn Kilohertz sehr \u00e4hnlich ist und da sie hinsichtlich Mittelohrentz\u00fcndungen sehr robust ist. In der Zahnmedizin ist sie aufgrund ihrer Anf\u00e4lligkeit f\u00fcr Parodontitis und Zahnkaries ein geeignetes Modell. Ebenfalls gut geeignet ist sie f\u00fcr Untersuchungen zur Entstehung von Melanomen der Haut. In der Krebs- und der Transplantationsforschung erwies sie sich als vergleichsweise widerstandsf\u00e4hig gegen\u00fcber R\u00f6ntgenstrahlung.Ein wichtiges Einsatzgebiet ist die parasitologische Forschung. So wurde sie als Modellwirt f\u00fcr die Bakterien Bordetella bronchiseptica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium piliforme, Mycoplasma, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis und Leptospira verwendet. Empf\u00e4nglich ist sie zudem f\u00fcr die Einzeller Leishmania, Toxoplasma und Babesia, den Bandwurm Echinococcus, Filarien und andere Fadenw\u00fcrmer wie Ascaris, Dipetalonema, Nematospiroides und Trichostrongylus sowie den Gro\u00dfen Leberegel. Au\u00dferdem ist sie hochempf\u00e4nglich f\u00fcr Virusinfektionen des Atemtraktes sowie alle Viren der Poliovirus- und Coxsackie-Gruppe und daher ein geeignetes Modell zur Entwicklung von Impfstoffen.Die Mongolische Rennmaus wird in vielen pharmakologischen Versuchen eingesetzt. Gegen\u00fcber Hamstern und M\u00e4usen verl\u00e4uft die sp\u00e4te vorgeburtliche Entwicklung langsamer, so dass eine genaue zeitliche Abstimmung der Verabreichung von Medikamenten und die Erholung der Embryos m\u00f6glich sind. Untersucht wurden die Wirkung von Prochlorperazin auf den Stoffwechsel, von den Tranquilizern Reserpin und Chlorpromazin, welche eine Erh\u00f6hung der Homovanillins\u00e4ure-Konzentration im Gehirn ausl\u00f6sten, von Triethylzinn, Silbernitrat, Pentylenetetrazol, Flurothyl und Cobalt auf Hirnsch\u00e4den, die Reaktion des Krummdarms auf Nikotin und Acetylcholin sowie die Blockwirkung von Atropin, Morphin und Adrenalin. In Verhaltensstudien wurde die Wirkung von Alkohol, Amphetaminen, Barbituraten und Cannabinoiden beobachtet und in toxikologischen Untersuchungen die von Karzinogenen, Pestiziden und Schwermetallen. So verursacht der k\u00fcnstliche S\u00fc\u00dfstoff Cyclamat chromosomale Sch\u00e4den in Knochenmarkzellen und eine chronische Bleivergiftung verursacht \u00e4hnliche histopathologische und h\u00e4matologische Ver\u00e4nderungen wie beim Menschen.Ihre spezialisierten Talgdr\u00fcsen bieten sich f\u00fcr die Akneforschung an und durch ihren einzigartigen Fettstoffwechsel ist sie ein geeignetes Modell in der Cholesterinforschung. Eine Ern\u00e4hrung mit einem Cholesteringehalt \u00fcber 0,2\u00a0Prozent f\u00fchrt zu einer Anreicherung von Cholesterin in der Leber und dadurch zu Leberverfettung, Leberzirrhose und Einschr\u00e4nkung der Leberfunktion. Trotz Lip\u00e4mie kommt es jedoch nicht zu einer Arteriosklerose.Neurologische Untersuchungen betreffen unter anderem spontan auftretende und herbeigef\u00fchrte Kr\u00e4mpfe und den Blutkreislauf des Gehirns. Sie eignet sich als Modell f\u00fcr eine lokale Blutleere des menschlichen Gehirns und somit in der Schlaganfallforschung. So f\u00fchrt bei Tieren mit unvollst\u00e4ndigem Arterienring eine einseitige Abschn\u00fcrung der gemeinsamen Kopfschlagader auf der gleichen Seite zu einem Hirninfarkt. Haltungsbedingungen Die Mongolische Rennmaus wird h\u00e4ufig als pflegeleicht und anspruchslos in der Haltung beschrieben. Jedoch stehen einer artgerechten Haltung als Heimtier insbesondere die Unwissenheit des Halters sowie klimatische Umweltfaktoren und als Versuchstier Reizarmut entgegen. Die verwendeten Haltungseinrichtungen beruhen eher auf Alltagserfahrungen als auf wissenschaftlich gesicherten Erkenntnissen.Die optimale Temperatur liegt zwischen 19 und 24\u00a0Grad Celsius. Werte unter 15\u00a0Grad und \u00fcber 29\u00a0Grad Celsius k\u00f6nnen f\u00fcr neugeborene, alte oder kranke Tiere problematisch sein. Schwankungen innerhalb dieses Bereiches werden jedoch problemlos vertragen. Die optimale relative Luftfeuchtigkeit liegt zwischen 30 und 50\u00a0Prozent. Werte \u00fcber 50\u00a0Prozent schr\u00e4nken insbesondere in Verbindung mit hohen Temperaturen die Regulierung der K\u00f6rpertemperatur empfindlich ein. Die erforderliche Luftwechselrate ist von der Belegungsdichte und der Art des Geheges abh\u00e4ngig. Dabei wird ein Luftzug mit einer Geschwindigkeit bis 0,25\u00a0Metern pro Sekunde vertragen. H\u00f6here Luftgeschwindigkeiten beeintr\u00e4chtigen ebenfalls die Regulierung der K\u00f6rpertemperatur. Die Mongolische Rennmaus kann sich an eine Tagesl\u00e4nge von 12 bis 14\u00a0Stunden mit einer Beleuchtungsst\u00e4rke bis 60\u00a0Lux anpassen. Schwankungen k\u00f6nnen zu Ver\u00e4nderungen im Verhalten und in der K\u00f6rperfunktion f\u00fchren. A-bewertete Schalldruckpegel \u00fcber 50\u00a0Dezibel f\u00fchren zu Stressbelastungen und auch pl\u00f6tzliche Ger\u00e4usche sowie Ultraschall k\u00f6nnen der Gesundheit schaden.Die Menge des anzubietenden Grundfutters betr\u00e4gt etwa zehn Gramm je Tier und Tag. Fettfutter wird bevorzugt angenommen und kann im \u00dcberma\u00df zu Verfettung f\u00fchren. Saftfutter dient der Wasserversorgung, kann jedoch die jederzeitige Verf\u00fcgbarkeit von freiem Trinkwasser nicht ersetzen. Ein geeignetes Gehege ber\u00fccksichtigt durch Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, Strukturierung und dreidimensionale Raumgestaltung das Bewegungs- und Erkundungsbed\u00fcrfnis der Mongolischen Rennmaus. Die Gew\u00e4hrung von Auslauf ist m\u00f6glich. In der Versuchstierhaltung werden meist die K\u00e4figtypen III und IV verwendet (820 cm\u00b2 und 1.800 cm\u00b2 Grundfl\u00e4che). Als Einstreu wird Sand bevorzugt, sonst dient ein Sandbad der Regulierung der K\u00f6rpertemperatur. Eine Freilandhaltung mit \u00dcberwinterung ist m\u00f6glich, wenn die Anlage eines Gangsystems bis in den frostfreien Bereich m\u00f6glich ist.Artgenossen sind aufgrund der geselligen Lebensweise der Mongolischen Rennmaus besonders wichtig. F\u00fcr das sp\u00e4tere Leben ben\u00f6tigte Verhaltensmuster werden erlernt und Sch\u00e4den werden vermieden, wenn die Trennung von den Elterntieren erst erfolgt, nachdem Erfahrungen bei der Pflege des nachfolgenden Wurfes gesammelt werden konnten. Bei Paar- und Gruppenhaltung kann es jedoch zu aggressiven Auseinandersetzungen bis hin zu Besch\u00e4digungsk\u00e4mpfen kommen. In der Versuchstierhaltung ist die Verpaarung von einem M\u00e4nnchen mit einem Weibchen erfolgreicher als die Verpaarung von einem M\u00e4nnchen mit zwei bis drei Weibchen. Bei Versuchen, die Einzelhaltung erfordern, scheinen sich M\u00e4nnchen besser zu eignen als Weibchen."}, {"description": "Systematik Innerhalb der Rennratten ordnen Ellerman und Morrison-Scott (1951), Musser und Carleton (1993), Pawlinow (2003) sowie Musser und Carleton (2005) die Mongolische Rennmaus als eine von mehreren Arten der Untergattung Pallasiomys zu. Pawlinow und Rossolimo (1987) f\u00fchren sie innerhalb dieser Untergattung als einzige Art der Meriones unguiculatus-Gruppe. Ellerman (1941) erkennt Pallasiomys dagegen nicht an und ordnet die Gruppe der Untergattung Meriones zu. Laut molekulargenetischen Untersuchungen der mitochondrialen Cytochrom-b- und 12S-rRNA-Gene ist die Mongolische Rennmaus enger mit der Mittagsrennmaus als mit der Libyschen Rennmaus, der K\u00f6nigsrennmaus und der Sundevall-Rennmaus verwandt.Bis zu vier Unterarten der Mongolischen Rennmaus werden unterschieden: Meriones unguiculatus unguiculatus (Milne-Edwards, 1867)\u00a0\u2013 in der Mongolei und in China au\u00dfer der Mandschurei Meriones unguiculatus kurauchii Mori, 1930\u00a0\u2013 in der Mandschurei Meriones unguiculatus selenginus (Heptner, 1949)\u00a0\u2013 in Daurien Meriones unguiculatus koslovi (Satunin, 1903)\u00a0\u2013 im Westen der Mongolei und m\u00f6glicherweise in Tuwa Nach S\u00fcden hin wird die Fellfarbe heller und die L\u00e4nge des Schwanzes nimmt zu. So ist die daurische Unterart am dunkelsten und hat den k\u00fcrzesten Schwanz. Allen (1940) ordnet koslovi und chihfengensis als Synonyme Meriones unguiculatus zu. Koslovi wird als unterseits klarer wei\u00df, ohne die bei unguiculatus manchmal vorkommende gelbliche F\u00e4rbung und mit einem beinahe ovalen Zwischenscheitelbein beschrieben. Diese Merkmale sind jedoch vermutlich starker Streuung unterworfen und rechtfertigen daher m\u00f6glicherweise keine Anerkennung als eigenst\u00e4ndige Unterart. Ellerman (1941) f\u00fchrt Meriones koslovi als eigenst\u00e4ndige Art in der Meriones libycus-Gruppe und Meriones kurauchii als nicht n\u00e4her zugeordnete, eigenst\u00e4ndige Art. Ellerman und Morrison-Scott (1951) ordnen koslovi und chihfengensis als Synonyme Meriones unguiculatus unguiculatus zu und f\u00fchren Meriones unguiculatus kurauchii provisorisch als weitere Unterart. Corbet (1978) ordnet Meriones unguiculatus unguiculatus die Synonyme chihfengensis, koslovi und kurauchii zu und listet Meriones unguiculatus selenginus als weitere Unterart. Gromow und Jerbajewa (1995) erw\u00e4hnen die Unterarten Meriones unguiculatus selenginus und Meriones unguiculatus koslovi. Laut Smith und Hoffmann (2008) kommt in China nur die Unterart Meriones unguiculatus unguiculatus vor. Nomenklatur Alphonse Milne-Edwards beschrieb die Mongolische Rennmaus 1867 als Gerbillus unguiculatus. Die ersten drei Exemplare sammelte Armand David am Morgen des 14.\u00a0April 1866 vermutlich etwa zehn Kilometer nord\u00f6stlich von \u201eTschang-Kur\u201c im Norden Shanxis und er sandte mehrere Exemplare an das Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle in Paris. Ein Typusexemplar wurde nicht festgelegt. Der Artname unguiculatus (\u201amit Kr\u00e4llchen\u2018) leitet sich von lateinisch unguiculus, einer Verkleinerungsform von unguis (\u201aNagel, Kralle\u2018), ab.Benannt nach Pjotr Koslow beschrieb Konstantin Satunin 1903 ein Exemplar vom Unterlauf des Chowd im Westen der Mongolei als Gerbillus kozlovi oder Gerbillus koslovi. Ein Exemplar aus Liaoyuan in der zentralen Mandschurei beschrieb Mori Tamezo 1930 als Meriones kurauchii und ein Exemplar aus Chifeng in der Inneren Mongolei 1939 als Meriones kurauchii chihfengensis. Wladimir Geptner beschrieb ein Exemplar aus der Umgebung von Kjachta im S\u00fcden Burjatiens nahe der Selenga 1949 als Pallasiomys unguiculatus selenginus.Oldfield Thomas ordnete die Mongolische Rennmaus 1908 erstmals als Meriones unguiculatus der Gattung Meriones zu und Geptner 1933 als Pallasiomys unguiculatus der neuen Gattung Pallasiomys."}, {"description": "Das Verbreitungsgebiet der Mongolischen Rennmaus sind die Mongolei und angrenzende Gebiete im Norden Chinas, in der Mandschurei und im S\u00fcden Sibiriens. In der Mongolei kommt sie in der Gro\u00dfen Seensenke, dem Tal der Seen, dem s\u00fcdlichen Changai-Gebirge, im nord\u00f6stlichen Changai-Gebirge entlang der Flussl\u00e4ufe von Orchon und Selenge, in der Mittel-Chalcha, der Nord-Gobi und der Ost-Mongolei vor.In China ist sie im Zentrum und Norden der Inneren Mongolei sowie vom Osten Gansus \u00fcber den Norden Ningxias, Shaanxis und Shanxis bis Hebei und Liaoning verbreitet. \u00d6stlich kommt sie bis Manjur und Hailar in der Inneren Mongolei sowie Tongyu und Changchun in Jilin vor, s\u00fcdlich bis Chifeng und Hohhot in der Inneren Mongolei und bis ins Ordos-Plateau nordwestlich von Jingbian in Shaanxi. Von Funden aus dem Hami-Gebirge und dem Bogda-Gebirge wurde berichtet, jedoch ist ihr Vorkommen in Xinjiang umstritten.Aus den Steppen Dauriens war sie bis 1939 nicht bekannt, in den 1940er Jahren entstanden jedoch zwei durch mehr als 300\u00a0Kilometer von ihrem Hauptverbreitungsgebiet getrennte Populationen am Unterlauf des Orchon und am Unda. Sie erreichte diese Nordgrenze vermutlich indem sie eingeschleppt wurde. \u00dcber Kjachta und Dschida in Burjatien und Borsja in der Region Transbaikalien verbreitete sie sich weiter nach Norden, Osten und Westen \u00fcber den Jenissei und bis nach Tuwa. Den S\u00fcden Tuwas erreicht sie \u00fcber die Gro\u00dfe Seensenke in der Mongolei. Im Westen und Osten des Tannu-ola-Gebirges kommt sie bis in eine H\u00f6he von 2100\u00a0Metern \u00fcber dem Meeresspiegel vor.Fossilfunde der Mongolischen Rennmaus sind aus dem Altpleistoz\u00e4n Dauriens bekannt."}, {"description": "E.

Dens may be found anywhere sheltered from the elements: in crevices between rocks, in hollow logs, and the like. ReproductionA male's range will include the ranges of several females, and scent cues inform him when the female is in heat. The gestation period is believed to be 60 to 70 days, and most pregnancies result in one to three (usually two) young. The male does not help care for them. FeedingThe slender mongoose is primarily carnivorous, though it is an opportunistic omnivore. Insects make up the bulk of its diet, but lizards, rodents, snakes, birds, amphibians, and the occasional fruit are eaten when available. It will also eat carrion and eggs.

The Lynx genus is now accepted, and the bobcat is listed as Lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources.Johnson et al. reported Lynx shared a clade with the puma, leopard cat (Prionailurus), and domestic cat (Felis) lineages, dated to 7.15\u00a0million years ago (mya); Lynx diverged first, approximately 3.24 million years ago.The bobcat is believed to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur (see felid hybrid).

Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots. A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida. They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern.The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and will swim when it needs to, but will normally avoid water.The adult bobcat is 47.5 to long from the head to the base of the tail, averaging 82.7 cm; the stubby tail adds 9 to and its \"bobbed\" appearance gives the species its name. An adult stands about 30 to at the shoulders. Adult males can range in weight from 6.4 to, with an average of 9.6 kg; females at 4 to, with an average of 6.8 kg.Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife.

Union Leader The largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern Canada and northern New England of the subspecies (L. r. gigas), while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies (L. r. floridanus), particularly those in the southern Appalachians. The bobcat is muscular, and its hind legs are longer than its front legs, giving it a bobbing gait. At birth, it weighs 0.6 to and is about 10 in in length. By its first birthday, it will reach about 10 lb.The cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats.Nowell, K. and Jackson, P. (1996). Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan.

A morphological size comparison study in the eastern United States found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes."}, {"description": "In Native American mythology, the bobcat is often twinned with the figure of the coyote in a theme of duality.\"Lynx\" is used generically in mythological descriptions, but necessarily implies the bobcat throughout much of the United States Lynx and coyote are associated with the fog and wind, respectively\u2014two elements representing opposites in Amerindian folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, L\u00e9vi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.In a Shawnee tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, which gives rise to its spots. After trapping the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire, only to have the embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots. The Mohave believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes. European settlers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it \"rests prominently in the anthology of\u00a0... national folklore.\""}, {"description": "The adult bobcat has few predators other than humans, although it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves will kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. There is at least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass.Kittens may be taken by several predators, including owls, eagles, and foxes, as well as other adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reportedly observed preying on adult bobcats.Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.The bobcat may have external parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and will often carry the parasites of its prey, especially those of rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation."}, {"description": "The bobcat is an adaptable animal. It prefers woodlands\u2014deciduous, coniferous, or mixed\u2014but unlike the other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It will make its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.The bobcat's range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can find a suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species. The animal may appear in back yards in \"urban edge\" environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats. If chased by a dog, it will usually climb up a tree.The historical range of the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. Range maps typically show a pocket of territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, where it is no longer thought to exist, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, bobcats sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston, TX. In August and September, 2010, a number of sightings were reported in the Houston suburbs of Pearland and Friendswood.Its population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and will wait out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country."}, {"description": "It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not considered threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of \"least concern\", noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is of least concern The species is considered endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It was removed from the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey at the turn of the 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. L. r. escuinipae, the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.The bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. Indirectly, kittens are most vulnerable to hunting given their dependence on an adult female for the first few months of life. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas."}, {"description": "The bobcat is crepuscular. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night it will move from 2 to along its habitual route. This behavior may vary seasonally, as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder months. Social structure and home range Bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on gender and the distribution of prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat will have numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.The sizes of bobcats' home ranges vary significantly; a World Conservation Union (IUCN) summary of research suggests ranges from 0.02 to. One study in Kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly 8 sqmi, and females less than half that area. Transient bobcats were found to have both larger (roughly 22 sqmi) and less well-defined home ranges. Kittens had the smallest range at about 3 sqmi. Research has shown dispersal from the natal range is most pronounced with males.Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from 16 sqmi in summer up to 40 sqmi in winter. Another found that female bobcats, especially those which were reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies. Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation.Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges will often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple male territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures are divergent, from one to 38 bobcats per 10 sqmi in one survey. The average is estimated at one bobcat per 5 sqmi. A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio. One study noted a dense, unhunted population in California had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female. When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female. Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested the males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and this would help limit reproduction until various factors lowered the density. Hunting and dietThe bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food, but will eat heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it will often prey on larger animals it can kill and return to feed on later. The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing it with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals weighing about 1.5 to. Its main prey varies by region. In the eastern United States, it is the eastern cottontail species, and in the north it is the snowshoe hare. When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat. In the far south, the rabbits and hare are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source. The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that, unlike the more specialized Canadian lynx, will readily vary its prey selection. Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet.The bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and will adjust its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents (including squirrels), birds, fish, and insects, it will hunt in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close. It will then pounce, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as rabbits and hares, it will stalk from cover and wait until they come within 20 to before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it will feed on larger animals, such as young ungulates and other carnivores such as fishers, foxes, minks, skunks, small dogs and domesticated cats. Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane. Bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry. While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants, such as sheep and goats. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.It has been known to kill deer, especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canadian lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative. Reproduction and life cycle Bobcats typically live to six or eight years of age, with a few reaching beyond ten. The longest they have been known to live is 16 years in the wild and 32 years in captivity.They generally begin breeding by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male will be fertile into the summer. A dominant male will travel with a female and mate with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males will generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.The female raises the young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes a second litter is born as late as September. The female generally gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They will be hunting by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring."}, {"description": "The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American mammal of the cat family Felidae, appearing during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO).Paleobiology Database, collection 20397 Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Authorized and entered by Dr. John Alroy, Macquarie University, April 30, 1994. With 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edges, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but local populations are vulnerable to extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals. The bobcat is vital for controlling pest populations. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the mid-sized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from insects, chickens, and small rodents to deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces.

It was discovered in 1818 by \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and is characterized by an all-white ventral surface, grizzled dorsal coloration, and conical face. It has exceptionally good eyesight, a trait which is common in old world bats and enables it to find roosting locations. It has adapted itself to a wide range of habitats including subarid scrub to semi-tropical savanna and can be found throughout much of Africa south of the Sahara, including many of the surrounding islands. Mauritian tomb bats help control pest populations, including insects that carry human diseases. These bats tend to be nocturnal hunters and their normal prey consists of moths, butterflies, and termites. Not prone to large scale roosting, T. mauritianus is most often spotted on the sides of buildings or on the trunks of trees in groups of around five individuals. They breed one average once or twice a year and rear usually one pup, though twins are occasionally reported. This species is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due their wide distribution and stable population."}, {"description": "The Mauritian tomb bat is often found in groups of around five individuals. These groups are usually either made up of entirely male or female individuals; when they are found in mixed gender groups, the two sexes are separated by at least 100\u00a0mm. Females live together in groups of three to thirty, while males live alone except during the mating season.* Unlike some species of bats, they do not roost close together in tight packs; instead they are found spaced out loosely, with the exception of a mother and her offspring. There are places where groups of at least a hundred bats have been found, one example being the Shai Hills Resource Reserve in Ghana.They usually roost with their ventral side flat against a surface. The Mauritian tomb bat is nocturnal and rests during the day; however, it does not sleep much and remains watchful while roosting. If disturbed, they will fly off to another site or move quickly up under the eaves of the building. Very rarely do they travel far from their day roosting site, and roosts are often recolonized. Over time these sites become stained with gular sack secretions and urine. The stains are typically a rectangular brown shape roughly 150\u00a0mm long and 100\u00a0mm wide.The semi-diurnal activity of tomb bats has led to the evolution of relatively good eyesight, unlike most echolocating bats. Their vision is very similar to the eyesight found in that of Old-World bats. The presence of the dim-light (RH1) gene in both the tomb bats and Old-World bats suggests convergent evolution of this gene in a similar light-rich environment. The Mauritian tomb bat can detect movement from a distance away, which suggests that the bat's eyesight is superior to that of other insect-eating bats. This advanced eyesight plays a large role in finding a suitable roost for the day and detecting predators. The Mauritian tomb bat is, for the most part, a nocturnal hunter, though it does occasionally forage during the day. They prefer to hunt in open spaces such as over an open field or body of water, so they can easily swoop down and grab the insects they feed on. The Mauritian tomb bat captures its prey and consumes it while in flight.Their preferred food is moths, though during daylight hours they will prey upon butterflies and termites. In regions where the bats live, they often are a factor in keeping pest populations down. This is important since the bats inhabit areas often plagued by insect-borne diseases such as malaria. They usually wait for complete darkness before foraging. Over open areas, they can detect their prey at long ranges. They periodically make dives when hunting, and with each dive, they increase the rate of echolocation. EcholocationThe bats use audible calls to communicate with each other. When at rest, they chirrup; when faced with an aggressive situation, they screech. They use social communication, touch, and chemical cues. In its home continent of Africa, it is well known for the squeaks, chirrups, and other noises that it makes that are barely audible to humans.When it is dark, they use echolocation calls to forage. During daylight hours, they can rely on vision to look for prey and intruders. The echolocation in T. mauritianus is unique in that their frequency pulses are emitted in patterns of twos and threes separated by long intervals of silence. This helps observers distinguish the species from other kinds of bats. The bats can adjust the frequency they emit to fit a given situation. For example, the bat can decrease the frequency to less than 20 Hertz to hunt insects that are attuned to bat echolocation, which gives them an advantage and increases their number of potential food sources. They are capable of emitting frequencies more than 25 Hertz, which allows them to hunt in less open habitats. This increases their range of habitats, and allows them to be flexible in their choice of environments. Mating and reproductionMauritian tomb bats are polygamous. Depending on the region, they mate either once or twice per year. Tomb bats of the Southern African subregion often produce two pups: one in February or March and another in October through December. Others mate in December with a gestation period of four to five months, and give birth in April or May. Mothers give birth to a single pup in a litter. Mothers take care of the young after birth; the males take no part in raising it. The pup clings to its mother's abdomen during flight and when perched. The young will remain with the mother, clinging to her chest wherever she goes, until it is able to fly. The mother nurses the young during this time. The young drink their mother's milk until they are weaned onto there adult diet of insects. The time spent with the mother allows the young to observe hunting behavior as well as learn other skills necessary for survival as an adult. Once the young bat is able to fly, it can forage for itself. It may stay with the mother's colony or find another when it is grown."}, {"description": "The Mauritian tomb bat is of \"Least Concern (LC)\" on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. Although its population and the population trend are unknown, the bat is easily found throughout its range. Mauritian tomb bats are widespread throughout Africa and neighboring islands. They are not listed as requiring special conservation action under any current programs."}, {"description": "The Mauritian tomb bat is distinguished from other species of bat by a completely white ventral area. The dorsal surface of T. mauritianus is a mottled color consisting of several shades of brown, gray, and white, which creates a grizzled \"salt and pepper\" appearance. Its fur is sleek and short, and the wing membranes are beige and primarily translucent. The wings are long, narrow, and shorten when not in flight in a way that facilitates crawling, a trait unique to this genus. Sexes are similar in color and size. Adults are generally lighter in color than juveniles, who have more of a gray hue. This species has a conically shaped face, which is covered in a thin layer of hair. The area below and in front of the eyes is bare, and the frontal portion of the face is sunken around the eyes. The eyes are large (2\u20133\u00a0mm). The ears are triangular-shaped, erect, and have rounded edges. The inner margins of the ear lack papillae, which is the inner sensory surface of the bat's ear. One of the larger species in the Microchiroptera suborder, fully grown adults weigh anywhere from 25 to 36\u00a0grams, with its forearm measuring 58 to 64 millimeters. The total length is from 100 to 110 millimeters. Sexual dimorphism T. mauritianus does not display an abundance of visual sexual dimorphism concerning their size or coloration. Outside of the breeding season, the male reproductive organs are held in the abdominal cavity. During the breeding season, the genitals appear and become darker in color. The males possess a gular sac that lies at the base of the jaw. This gland releases secretions that help males mark their territories and attract females during the mating season. The gular sac is present in some females, depending on which region Africa the bat is found. In areas such as Nigeria and Mozambique, the sac is absent in females, in West Africa it is reduced to a vestigial pouch, and in the Sudan it is fully present in both sexes, just more developed in males. In females, the genitals are located on the ventral side of the abdomen and are marked by two pigmented patches. During the mating season, they become deeply pigmented and extend out, becoming more prominent before and just after mating."}, {"description": "The Mauritian tomb bat is widely distributed from the middle to the southern regions of Africa, as well as on many of the surrounding islands. They are found in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, R\u00e9union, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Some Mauritian tomb bats have been found on Bourbon.Special kidney adaptations that aid in water conservation allow the Mauritian tomb bat to survive in the often dry, semi-arid regions of countries such as the Sudan and Chad. The bat's kidneys have a mean renal index of 5.55. This means that the bat's inner medulla, the part of the kidney that collects waste, is very large compared to the overall size of the organ, so that the animal can remove much of the waste out the water it drinks. The bats have a predicted mean maximum urine concentration of 3,921 mosmol/kg, which means the urine they produce is very concentrated. From this, scientists have tentatively come to the conclusion that this species' kidneys offer valuable water conservation.Mauritian tomb bats are occasionally found in grassland biomes as well as in semi-arid and tropical regions. They can be found in forests, rain forests, and grasslands. These bats can be found in the Sahara, which receives less than 500\u00a0mm of rainfall per year. The bats prefer open, moist savanna with plenty of maneuvering room with close proximity roosting sights. Often this species can be found near open swamps and rivers, where there is a steady food supply. They may need the open water for hunting. T. mauritianus avoids the thicker parts of tropical forests due to its somewhat limited turning maneuverability. In some countries, such as Sao Tom\u00e9 and Principe, groups of this species find homes in the cocoa trees of the large plantations, which offer an excellent environment with roosts, adequately spaced trees, and many insects to feed upon.The tomb bat prefers sites where there is overhead shelter, but are situated in exposed positions for easier take off. T. mauritianus's natural roosting locations include the trunks of palm trees, caves, and crevices. With the arrival of humans, they have adapted to a variety of new locations such as the sides of buildings and, as their name implies, tombs. They prefer buildings with bare brick surfaces as opposed to painted ones, as it offers better grip. They choose their day roosts so that take-off is unhindered by obstacles inhibiting flight."}, {"description": "The French naturalist \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire identified the Mauritian tomb bat in 1818 when he compared the at the time unknown specimen to another newly described bat from Egypt, the Egyptian tomb bat.

In recent years, substantial domestic markets existed in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam.In Myanmar, 301 body parts of at least 279 clouded leopards, mostly skins and skeletons, were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand, and cater to international buyers, although clouded leopards are completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation.

In captivity, they have been observed to climb down vertical tree trunks head first, and hang on to branches with their hind paws bent around branchings of tree limbs. They are capable of supination and can even hang down from branches only by bending their hind paws and their tail around them. When jumping down, they keep hanging on to a branch this way until the very last moment. They can climb on horizontal branches with their back to the ground, and in this position make short jumps forward. When balancing on thin branches, they use their long tails to steer. They can easily jump up to 1.2 m high.Hemmer, H. (1968).

Presumably such habits are used to mark their territory in the wild, although the size of their home ranges is unknown. Like other big cats, they do not appear able to purr, but they otherwise have a wide range of vocalisations, including mewing, hissing, growling, moaning, and snorting. When communicating, two individuals will emit low snorting sounds that are called prusten when approaching each other in a friendly manner. They also use long-call communication used over large distances, which could either be a type of mating call between different territories or a warning call to other cats encroaching on other territories. Apart from information stemming from observations of captive clouded leopards, little is known of their natural history and behavior in the wild. Early accounts depict them as rare, secretive, arboreal, and nocturnal denizens of dense primary forest. More recent observations suggest they may not be as arboreal and nocturnal as previously thought. They may use trees as daytime rest sites, but also spend a significant proportion of time on the ground. Some daytime movement has been observed, suggesting they are not strictly nocturnal but crepuscular. However, the time of day when they are active depends on their prey and the level of human disturbance.They live a solitary lifestyle, resting in trees during the day and hunting at night. When hunting, clouded leopards either come down from their perches in the trees and stalk their prey or lie and wait for the prey to come to them. After making a kill and eating, they usually retreat to the trees to digest and rest.\"Clouded Leopard.\" A-Z Animals. http://a-z-animals.com/animals/clouded-leopard/ 19 Apr. 2013.Their partly nocturnal and far-ranging behaviour, their low densities, and because they inhabit densely vegetated habitats and remote areas makes the counting and monitoring of clouded leopards extremely difficult. Consequently, little is known about their behaviour and status. Available information on their ecology is anecdotal, based on local interviews and a few sighting reports.Home ranges have only been estimated in Thailand: Four individuals were radio-collared in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary from April 2000 to February 2003. Home ranges of two females were 25.7 km2 and 22.9 km2, and of two males 29.7 km2 and 49.1 km2. Two individuals were radio-collared during a study from 1997 to 1999 in the Khao Yai National Park. The home range of one female was 39.4 km2, of the one male 42 km2. Both individuals had a core area of 2.9 km2.Austin, S. C., Tewes, M. E. (1999). Ecology of the clouded leopard in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. Cat News 31: 17\u201318. Little is known of the diet of clouded leopards. Their prey includes both arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates. Pocock presumed they are adapted for preying upon herbivorous mammals of considerable bulk because of their powerful build and the deep penetration of their bites, attested by their long canines. Confirmed prey species include hog deer, slow loris, brush-tailed porcupine, Malayan pangolin and Indochinese ground squirrel. Known prey species in China include barking deer and pheasants.Feng, L., Lin, L., Zhang, L., Wang, L., Wang, B., Luo A., Yang, S., Smith, J. L. D., Luo S. J. and Zhang, L. (2008). Evidence of wild tigers in southwest China \u2013 a preliminary survey of the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve. Cat News 48: 4\u20136. Captive clouded leopards also eat eggs and some vegetation. ReproductionBoth males and females average 26 months at first reproduction. Mating usually occurs during December and March. The males tend to be very aggressive during sexual encounters and have been known to bite the female on the neck during courtship, severing her vertebrae. With this in mind, male and female compatibility has been deemed extremely important when attempting breeding in captivity. The pair will meet and mate multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck and the female responds with vocalization that encourages the male to continue. The male then leaves and is not involved in raising the kittens. Estrus last 6 days on average, estrous cycle averages 30 days. After a gestation period of 93 \u00b1 6 days, females give birth to a litter of one to five, most often three cubs.Initially, the young are blind and helpless, much like the young of many other cats, and weigh from 140 to. Unlike adults, the kittens' spots are \"solid\" \u2014 completely dark rather than dark rings. The young can see within about 10 days of birth, are active within five weeks, and are fully weaned at around three months of age. They attain the adult coat pattern at around six months, and probably become independent after around 10 months. Females are able to bear one litter each year. The mother is believed to hide her kittens in dense vegetation while she goes to hunt, though little concrete evidence supports this theory, since their lifestyle is so secretive.In captivity, they have an average lifespan of 11 years. One individual has lived to be almost 17 years old."}, {"description": "Clouded leopards occur from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal and India to Myanmar, Bhutan, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Indochina, and in China south of the Yangtze River.

But in 1987 and 1988, four individuals were found in the central part of the country, close to Chitwan National Park and in the Pokhara Valley. These findings extended their known range westward, suggesting they are able to survive and breed in degraded woodlands that previously harboured moist subtropical semideciduous forest.Dinerstein, E. and J.

In captivity Early captive-breeding programs involving clouded leopards were not very successful, largely due to ignorance of courtship activity among them in the wild. Experience has taught keepers that introducing pairs of clouded leopards at a young age gives opportunities for the pair to bond and breed successfully. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female a secluded, off-exhibit area. Modern breeding programs involve carefully regulated introductions between prospective mating pairs, and take into account the requirements for enriched enclosures. Stimulating natural behavior by providing adequate space to permit climbing minimizes stress. This, combined with a feeding program that fulfills the proper dietary requirements, has promoted more successful breeding in recent years.In March 2011, two breeding females at the Nashville Zoo at Grassmere in Nashville, Tennessee, gave birth to three cubs, which are being raised by zookeepers. Each cub weighed a half pound.http://www.nashvillezoo.org/scripts/view_photo.asp?pressID=174 In June 2011, two cubs were born at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington.

They feed mostly on small pelagic schooling fish, particularly herring, capelin, and sprat. They will, however, eat squid and crustaceans in certain places. This species tends to feed close to the sea bottom, at least for waters less than 200 m deep. However, when hunting sprat, porpoise may stay closer to the surface. When in deeper waters, porpoises may forage for mid-water fish, such as pearlsides. Harbour porpoises tend to be solitary foragers, but they do sometimes hunt in packs and herd fish together. Young porpoises need to consume about 7% to 8% of their body weight each day to survive, which is approximately 15 pounds or 7 kilograms of fish. Significant predators of harbour porpoises include white sharks and killer whales (orcas). Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland have also discovered that the local bottlenose dolphins attack and kill harbour porpoises without eating them due to competition for a decreasing food supply. Also grey seals attack harbour porpoises by biting off chucks of fat as a high energy source. http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v513/p277-281/ Behaviour and reproductionSome studies suggest porpoises are relatively sedentary and usually don't leave a certain area for long. Nevertheless, they have been recorded to move from onshore to offshore waters along coast. Dives of 220m by harbour porpoises have been recorded. Dives can last five minutes but typically last one minute.Westgate AJ, Read AJ, Berggren P, Koopman HN, Gaskin DE (1995). Diving behaviour of harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena. Can. J. Fish Aquat. Sci. 52, 1064-1073. The social life of harbour porpoises is not well understood. They are generally seen as a solitary species. Most of the time, porpoises are either alone or in groups of no more than five animals. Porpoises mate promiscuously. Males produce large amounts of sperm, perhaps for sperm competition. Females become sexually mature by their third or fourth year and can calve each year for several consecutive years, being pregnant and lactating at the same time. The gestation of the porpoise is typically 10\u201311 months. Most births occur in late spring and summer. Calves are weaned after 8\u201312 months."}, {"description": "The English word porpoise comes from the French pourpois (old French porpais, 12th century), which is from Medieval Latin porcopiscus, which is a compound of porcus (pig) and piscus (fish). The old word is probably a loan-translation of a Germanic word, cf. Danish marsvin and Middle Dutch mereswijn (sea swine). Classical Latin had a similar name, porculus marinus, and the notion behind the name is probably a fancied resemblance of the snout to that of a pig or the sound of a porpoise breathing resembling a pig snort.

There are, however, a number of threats that impact population distribution and numbers. Interactions with fisheriesThe main threat to porpoises is static fishing techniques such as gill and tangle nets. Bycatch in bottom-set gill nets is considered the main anthropogenic mortality factor for harbour porpoises worldwide. Bycatch is reported from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the east coast of the United States and Canada. Bottom-set gill nets are anchored to the sea floor and are up to 12.5 miles (20 km) in length. It is unknown why porpoises become entangled in gill nets, since several studies indicate they are able to detect these nets using their echolocation.R. Kastelein, W. W. L. Au, and D. de Haan (2000).

Tougaard (2007). Echolocation signals of free-ranging harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena. J.Exp.Biol. 210 (1):56-64. Porpoise-scaring devices, so-called pingers, have been developed to keep porpoises out of nets and numerous studies have demonstrated they are very effective at reducing entanglement.S. D. Kraus, A.

The effect of acoustic alarms on the by-catch of harbour porpoises in the Danish North Sea gill net fishery. Paper SC/51/SM41 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee However, concern has been raised over the noise pollution created by the pingers and whether their efficiency will diminish over time due to porpoises habituating to the sounds.T. M. Cox, A. J. Read, A. Solow, and N. Tregenza (2001). Will harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) habituate to pingers? J.Cetacean.Res.Manage. 3 (1):81-86 Mortality resulting from trawling bycatch seems to be less of an issue, probably because porpoises are not inclined to feed inside trawls, as dolphins are known to do. Climate changeAn increase in the temperature of the sea water is likely to affect the distribution of porpoises and their prey, but has not been shown to occur. Reduced stocks of sand eel along the east coast of Scotland seems to have been the main reason for the malnutrition in porpoises in the area. OverfishingOverfishing may reduce preferred prey availability for porpoises. Overfishing resulting in the collapse of herring in the North Sea caused porpoises to hunt for other prey species. Reduction of prey may result from climate change, or overfishing, or both. Noise pollutionNoise from ship traffic and oil platforms is thought to affect the distribution of toothed whales, like the harbour porpoise, that use echolocation for communication and prey detection. The construction of thousands of offshore wind turbines,planned in different areas of North Sea, is known to cause displacement of porpoises from the construction site,J. Carstensen, O. D. Henriksen, and J. Teilmann (2006). Impacts on harbour porpoises from offshore wind farm construction: Acoustic monitoring of echolocation activity using porpoise detectors (T-PODs).

Porpoises have a coastal distribution that potentially brings them close to sources of pollution. Porpoises may not experience any toxic effects until they draw on their fat reserves, such as in periods of food shortage, migration or reproduction."}, {"description": "The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is one of six species of porpoise.

The harbour porpoise may be polytypic, with geographically distinct populations representing distinct races: P. p. phocoena in the North Atlantic and West Africa, P. p. relicta in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, an unnamed population in the northwest Pacific and P. p. vomerina in the northeast Pacific."}]}

A study of cheetahs in the Serengeti showed females are sexually promiscuous and often have cubs by many different males. Females give birth to up to nine cubs after a gestation period of ninety to ninety-eight days, although the average litter size is four. Cubs weigh from 150 to at birth. Unlike some other cats, the cheetah is born with its characteristic spots. Cubs are also born with a downy underlying fur on their necks, called a mantle, extending to mid-back. This gives them a mane or Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. It has been speculated this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the honey badger (ratel), to scare away potential aggressors.Eaton, Randall L. (1976) A Possible Case of Mimicry in Larger Mammals. Evolution 30(4):853-856 doi 10.2307/2407827 Cubs leave their mother between thirteen and twenty months after birth. Life span is up to twelve years in the wild, but up to twenty years in captivity. The rate of cub mortality varies from area to area, from 50% to 75%, and in extreme cases such as the Serengeti ecosystem, up to 90%. In comparison to the Serengeti, the survival rate of cheetah cubs in the Kgalagadi area was seven times higher.[1], Cheetah cub survival revisited: a re-evaluation of the role of predation, especially by lions, and implications for conservationUnlike males, females are solitary and tend to avoid each other, though some mother/daughter pairs have been known to be formed for small periods of time. The cheetah has a unique, well-structured social order. Females live alone, except when they are raising cubs and they raise their cubs on their own. The first eighteen months of a cub's life are important; cubs must learn many lessons, because survival depends on knowing how to hunt wild prey species and avoid other predators. At eighteen months, the mother leaves the cubs, who then form a sibling (\"sib\") group that will stay together for another six months. At about two years, the female siblings leave the group, and the young males remain together for life. Territories Males Males are often social and may group together for life, usually with their brothers in the same litter; although if a cub is the only male in the litter then two or three lone males may form a group, or a lone male may join an existing group. These groups are called coalitions. In one Serengeti, 41% of the adult males were solitary, 40% lived in pairs and 19% lived in trios.Richard Estes, foreword by Edward Osborne Wilson (1991) The Behavior Guide to African Mammals. University of California Press. Page 371.A coalition is six times more likely to obtain an animal territory than a lone male, although studies have shown that coalitions keep their territories just as long as lone males\u2014 between four to four and a half years.Males are territorial. Females' home ranges can be very large and a territory including several females' ranges is impossible to defend. Instead, males choose the points at which several of the females' home ranges overlap, creating a much smaller space, which can be properly defended against intruders while maximizing the chance of reproduction. Coalitions will try their best to maintain territories to find females with whom they will mate. The size of the territory also depends on the available resources; depending on the part of Africa, the size of a male's territory can vary greatly from 37 to. Males mark their territory by urinating on objects that stand out, such as trees, logs, or termite mounds. When male cheetahs urine-mark their territories, they stand less than one meter away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60\u00b0 upward. The whole coalition contributes to the scent. Males will attempt to kill any intruders, and fights result in serious injury or death.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxI2tjIy0kw Females Unlike males and other felines, females do not establish territories. Instead, the area they live in is termed a home range. These overlap with other females' home ranges, often those of their daughters, mothers, or sisters. Females always hunt alone, although cubs will accompany their mothers to learn to hunt once they reach the age of five to six weeks.The size of a home range depends entirely on the availability of prey. Cheetahs in southern African woodlands have ranges as small as 34 km2, while in some parts of Namibia they can reach 1500 km2. VocalizationsThe cheetah cannot roar, but ranks among the more vocal felids. Several sources refer to a wide variety of cheetah vocalizations, but most of these lack a detailed acoustic description which makes it difficult to reliably assess exactly what terms refer to exactly what vocalizations. A short review of the terminology encountered is found in. Some of the vocalizations listed in the literature are: Chirping: When a cheetah attempts to find another, or a mother tries to locate her cubs, it uses a high-pitched barking called chirping. The chirps made by a cheetah cub sound more like a bird chirping, and so are termed chirping, too. Churring or stuttering: This vocalization is emitted by a cheetah during social meetings. A churr can be seen as a social invitation to other cheetahs, an expression of interest, uncertainty, or appeasement or during meetings with the opposite sex (although each sex churrs for different reasons). Growling: This vocalization is often accompanied by hissing and spitting and is exhibited by the cheetah during annoyance, or when faced with danger. Yowling: This is an escalated version of growling, usually displayed when danger worsens. Agonistic vocalizations: a combination of growls, moans, hisses and the \"trademark\" cheetah spit, which is most often accompanied by a forceful \"paw hit\" on the ground. Purring: This is made when the cheetah is content, usually during pleasant social meetings (mostly between cubs and their mothers). A characteristic of purring is that it is realized on both egressive and ingressive airstream, as seen and heard on online video and audio. Diet and hunting The cheetah is a carnivore, eating mostly mammalian herbivores under 40 kg and that which specialise in eating C3 plants,[2], Cheetah menu: wildlife instead of cattle . including the Thomson's gazelle, the Grant's gazelle, the springbok, impala and blesbok. The young of larger mammals such as wildebeests and zebras are taken at times, and adults too, when cheetahs hunt in groups. Guineafowl and hares are also prey. Ostriches are also taken on occasion. In Iran, cheetahs prey on the Chinkara, Goitered gazelle, ibexes and wild sheep.[3], Feeding ecology of the Asiatic cheetah Acinonyx jubatus venaticus in low prey habitats in northeastern Iran: Implications for effective conservation.While the other big cats often hunt by night, the cheetah is a diurnal hunter. It will, however, hunt on moonlit nights during the full Moon as well, where visibility is excellent.Hunter, Luke & Hamman, Dave. Cheetah. Struik Publishers, 2003, p. 109. It hunts usually either early in the morning or later in the evening when it is not too hot, but there is still enough light.The cheetah hunts by vision rather than by scent. Prey is stalked to within 10 -, then chased. This is usually over in less than a minute, and if the cheetah fails to make a catch quickly, it will give up. The cheetah has an average hunting success rate of around 50%. Cheetahs can run at a very high speed; in just two seconds they can reach a speed of 75 kilometers per hour. The estimated top speed of the cheetah ranges from 90 to 128 kilometers per hour. Cheetahs refuse to run when their body temperature reaches 40.5\u00a0\u00b0C.\"Wild Cats of the World\" - by Mel Sunquist and Fiona Sunquist Running at very high speeds puts a great deal of strain on the cheetah's body. When sprinting, the cheetah's body temperature quickly elevates. If it is a hard chase, it sometimes needs to rest for half an hour or more.The cheetah kills its prey by tripping it during the chase, then biting it on the underside of the throat to suffocate it; the cheetah is not strong enough to break the necks of most prey. The bite may also puncture a vital artery in the neck. Then the cheetah proceeds to devour its catch as quickly as possible before the kill is taken by stronger predators.Data from 367 runs by three female and two male adults, with an average run distance of 173 m, showed that hunting cheetahs can run 58 miles (93\u00a0km) per hour. A recent study that followed five African cheetahs indicated that cheetahs relied most heavily on acceleration. Most chases involved extreme maneuverability more than speed. The study indicated that cheetahs seemed to rarely run close to 60\u00a0mph or more; on most hunts they reached 30 to 35\u00a0mph, but they accelerated and changed direction much more rapidly than any other land animal.The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle. This small antelope is smaller than the cheetah, which makes it an appropriate prey. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal, the main species of the cheetah's prey preference is the significantly larger nyala, which can weigh up to 130 kg in the male.Hunter, Luke & Hamman, Dave 2003, p. 96. Cheetahs look for individuals that have strayed some distance from their group, and do not necessarily seek out old or weak ones. Interspecific predatory relationshipsDespite their speed and hunting prowess, cheetahs are largely outranked by other large predators in most of their range. Because they have evolved for short bursts of extreme speed at the expense of their power, they cannot defend themselves against most of Africa's other predator species. They usually avoid fighting and will surrender a kill immediately to even a single hyena, rather than risk injury. Because cheetahs rely on their speed to obtain their meals, any injury that slows them down could essentially be life-threatening.A cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and by eating immediately after the kill. Due to the reduction in habitat in Africa, cheetahs in recent years have faced greater pressure from other native African predators as available range declines.The cheetah's mortality is very high during the early weeks of its life; up to 90% of cheetah cubs are killed during this time by lions, leopards, hyenas, African Wild Dogs, or even by eagles. Cheetah cubs often hide in thick brush for safety. Mother cheetahs will defend their young and are at times successful in driving predators away from their cubs. Coalitions of male cheetahs can also chase away other predators, depending on the coalition size and the size and number of the predator. Because of its speed, a healthy adult cheetah has few enemies."}, {"description": "Economic importanceCheetah fur was formerly regarded as a status symbol. Today, cheetahs have a growing economic importance for ecotourism and they are also found in zoos. White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, which maintains a significant population of cheetahs, has cited that captive management presents challenges because of health, nutrition and socialization of the cats, but that these have been overcome through collaborations among wildlife facilities.Cheetahs are far less aggressive than other felids and can be tamed, so cubs are sometimes illegally sold as pets.Cheetahs were formerly, and sometimes still are, hunted because many farmers believe that they eat livestock. When the species came under threat, numerous campaigns were launched to try to educate farmers and encourage them to conserve cheetahs. Recent evidence has shown that cheetahs will not attack and eat livestock if they can avoid doing so, as they prefer their wild prey. However, they have no problem with including farmland as part of their territory, leading to conflict. Taming Ancient Egyptians often kept cheetahs as pets, and also tamed and trained them for hunting. (But not domesticated i.e., bred under human control.) Cheetahs would be taken to hunting fields in low-sided carts or by horseback, hooded and blindfolded, and kept on leashes while dogs flushed out their prey. When the prey was near enough, the cheetahs would be released and their blindfolds removed. This tradition was passed on to the ancient Persians and brought to India, where the practice was continued by Indian princes into the twentieth century. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance, their use as pets spreading just as their hunting skills were. Other such princes and kings kept them as pets, including Genghis Khan and Charlemagne, who boasted of having kept cheetahs within their palace grounds. Akbar the Great, ruler of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1605, kept as many as 1,000 cheetahs. As recently as the 1930s, the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, was often photographed leading a cheetah by a leash.Cheetahs are still tamed in the modern world. One example is Burmani, who has been raised in England at Eagle Heights wild animal park from the age of three months. He was bred in a deer park in Germany. He is so tame that he has lost his hunting instinct. Conservation statusCheetah cubs have a high mortality rate due to predation by other carnivores, such as the lion and hyena, and perhaps genetic factors. It has been suggested that the low genetic diversity of cheetahs is a cause of poor sperm, birth defects, cramped teeth, curled tails, and bent limbs. Some biologists even believe that they are too inbred to flourish as a species. Note, however, that they lost most of their genetic diversity thousands of years ago (see the beginning of this article), and yet seem to have only been in decline in the last century or so, suggesting that factors other than genetics are mainly responsible.Cheetahs are included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list of vulnerable species (African subspecies threatened, Asiatic subspecies in critical situation) as well as on the US Endangered Species Act: threatened species - Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). Approximately 12,400 cheetahs remain in the wild in twenty-five African countries; Namibia has the most, with about 2,500. Another 50 to 60 critically endangered Asiatic cheetahs are thought to remain in Iran. There have been successful breeding programs, including the use of in vitro fertilisation, in zoos around the world.Founded in Namibia in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund's mission is to be the world's resource charged with protecting the cheetah and to ensure its future. The organization works with all stakeholders within the cheetah's ecosystem to develop best practices in research, education and ecology and create a sustainable model from which all other species, including people, will benefit.The South African Cheetah Conservation Foundation has close links and assists in training and sharing program successes with other countries where cheetahs live, including Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Iran and Algeria. The organization's international program includes distributing materials, lending resources and support, and providing training through Africa and the rest of the world. Re-introduction project in India Asiatic cheetahs have been known to exist in India for a very long time, but as a result of hunting and other causes, cheetahs have been extinct in India since the 1940s. A captive propagation project has been proposed. Minister of Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh told the Rajya Sabha on 7 July 2009, \"The cheetah is the only animal that has been described extinct in India in the last 100 years. We have to get them from abroad to repopulate the species.\" He was responding to a call for attention from Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"The plan to bring back the cheetah, which fell to indiscriminate hunting and complex factors like a fragile breeding pattern is audacious given the problems besetting tiger conservation.\" Two naturalists, Divya Bhanusinh and MK Ranjit Singh, suggested importing cheetahs from Africa, after which they will be bred in captivity and, in time, released in the wild.The Times of India, Thursday, July 9, 2009, p. 11.However, the plan to reintroduce the African cheetahs to India has been suspended after discovering the distinctness between the cheetahs from Asia and Africa, having been separated between 32,000 to 67,000 years ago."}, {"description": "There are several geographically isolated populations of cheetah, all of which are found in Africa or southwestern Asia. A small population (estimated at about 50) survive in the Khorasan Province of Iran, where conservationists are taking steps to protect them.It is possible, though doubtful, that some cheetahs remain in India. There have also been several unconfirmed reports of Asiatic Cheetahs in the Balochistan province of Pakistan, with at least one dead animal being discovered recently.The cheetah thrives in areas with vast expanses of land where prey is abundant. The cheetah likes to live in an open biotope, such as semidesert, prairie, and thick brush, though it can be found in a variety of habitats. In Namibia, for example, it lives in grasslands, savannahs, areas of dense vegetation, and mountainous terrain.In much of its former range, the cheetah was tamed by aristocrats and used to hunt antelopes in much the same way as is still done with members of the greyhound group of dogs."}, {"description": "In Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (1523), the god's chariot is borne by cheetahs (which were used as hunting animals in Renaissance Italy). Cheetahs were often associated with the god Dionysus, whom the Romans called Bacchus. George Stubbs' Cheetah with Two Indian Attendants and a Stag (1764\u20131765) also shows the cheetah as a hunting animal and commemorates the gift of a cheetah to George III by the English Governor of Madras, Sir George Pigot The Caress (1896), by the Belgian symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff (1858\u20131921), is a representation of the myth of Oedipus and the Sphinx and portrays a creature with a woman's head and a cheetah's body (often misidentified as a leopard's). Andr\u00e9 Mercier's Our Friend Yambo (1961) is a curious biography of a cheetah adopted by a French couple and brought to live in Paris. It is seen as a French answer to Born Free (1960), whose author, Joy Adamson, produced a cheetah biography of her own, The Spotted Sphinx (1969). Hussein, An Entertainment, a novel by Patrick O'Brian set in India of the British Raj period, illustrates the practice of royalty keeping and training cheetahs to hunt antelopes. The book How It Was with Dooms tells the true story of a family raising an orphaned cheetah cub named Duma (the Swahili word for cheetah) in Kenya. The films Cheetah (1989) and Duma (2005) were both loosely based on this book. Similarly, Roger Hunt successfully tames a cheetah in Willard Price's Safari Adventure, after rescuing it from an elephant pit trap. The cheetah soon befriends a German shepherd dog called Zulu. The animated series ThunderCats had a main character who was an anthropomorphic cheetah named Cheetara. In 1986, Frito-Lay introduced an anthropomorphic cheetah, Chester Cheetah, as the mascot for their Cheetos. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle has a subplot involving an escaped cheetah, which later smokes cannabis with the pair and allows them to ride it. Comic book superheroine Wonder Woman's chief adversary is Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva, alias The Cheetah. On the CGI animated show Beast Wars: Transformers, Cheetor, one of the main characters on the Maximal faction, had the beast form of a cheetah. This was also carried over as the beast form of the Cheetor Hasbro transformer. The Japanese anime Damekko D\u014dbutsu features a clumsy but sweet-natured cheetah named Chiiko. The first release of Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X was code-named \"Cheetah\", which set the pattern for the subsequent releases being named after big cats. In Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light the character Witterquick as the totem of a Cheetah and could turn into one. Titled \"Hunting at 60 mph\", the PlayStation 3 game Afrika features a Cheetah hunting a gazelle as the game's first \"big game hunt\"."}, {"description": "The genus name, Acinonyx, means \"no-move-claw\" in Greek, while the species name, jubatus, means \"maned\" or \"crested\" in Latin, a reference to the dorsal crest found in cheetah cubs. The cheetah has unusually low genetic variability. This is accompanied by a very low sperm count, motility, and deformed flagella. Skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs illustrate the former point, in that there is no rejection of the donor skin. It is thought that the species went through a prolonged period of inbreeding following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age. This suggests that genetic monomorphism did not prevent the cheetah from flourishing across two continents for thousands of years.The cheetah likely evolved in Africa during the Miocene epoch (26 million to 7.5 million years ago), before migrating to Asia. Recent research has placed the last common ancestor of all existing populations as living in Asia 11 million years ago, which may lead to revision and refinement of existing ideas about cheetah evolution.The now-extinct species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), much larger than the modern cheetah and found in Europe, India, and China; and Acinonyx intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period), found over the same range. The extinct genus Miracinonyx was extremely cheetah-like, but recent DNA analysis has shown that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, Miracinonyx studeri, and Miracinonyx trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America and called the \"North American cheetah\" are not true cheetahs, instead being close relatives to the cougar. SubspeciesAlthough many sources list six or more subspecies of cheetah, the taxonomic status of most of these subspecies is unresolved. Acinonyx rex\u2014the king cheetah\u2014was abandoned as a subspecies after it was discovered that the variation was caused by a single recessive gene. The subspecies Acinonyx jubatus guttatus, the woolly cheetah, may also have been a variation due to a recessive gene. Some of the most commonly recognized subspecies include: Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus): Asia (Afghanistan, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Russia). Current range is in Iran. Extinct in other Asian countries. Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki): Northwest Africa (Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Tunisia) and western Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal) Tanzanian cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus raineyii): Eastern Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda) Acinonyx jubatus jubatus: southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Namibia) Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii: central Africa (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, and Sudan) Acinonyx jubatus velox"}, {"description": "The word \"cheetah\" is derived from the Sanskrit word ', meaning \"variegated\", from the Hindi '\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e' (c\u012bt\u0101)."}, {"description": "The cheetah's chest is deep and its waist is narrow. The coarse, short fur of the cheetah is tan with round black spots measuring from 2 to across, affording it some camouflage while hunting. There are no spots on its white underside, but the tail has spots, which merge to form four to six dark rings at the end. The tail usually ends in a bushy white tuft. The cheetah has a small head with high-set eyes. Black \"tear marks\" running from the corner of its eyes down the sides of the nose to its mouth keep sunlight out of its eyes and aid in hunting and seeing long distances. Its thin and fragile body make it well-suited to short bursts of high speed, but not to long-distance running.Agility, rather than raw speed, accounts for much of the cheetah's ability to catch prey. Cheetahs can accelerate four times as fast as a human (thanks to greater muscle power) and can slow down by 14 kilometers per hour in one stride. They can hunt successfully in densely vegetated areas.The adult cheetah weighs from 21 to. Its total head-and-body length is from 110 to, while the tail can measure 60 to in length.Boitani, Luigi, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Mammals.

DK Adult (2005), ISBN 0-7894-7764-5 Cheetahs are 66 to tall at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have slightly bigger heads, but there is not a great variation in cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and females apart by appearance alone. Compared to a similarly sized leopard, the cheetah is generally shorter-bodied, but is longer tailed and taller (it averages about 90 cm tall) and so it appears more streamlined.Some cheetahs have a rare fur pattern mutation of larger, blotchy, merged spots. Known as \"king cheetahs,\" they were once thought to constitute a separate subspecies but are in fact African cheetahs; their unusual fur pattern is the result of a single recessive gene. The \"king cheetah\" has only been seen in the wild a handful of times, but it has been bred in captivity. The cheetah's paws have semi-retractable claws (known only in three other cat species: the fishing cat, the flat-headed cat and the Iriomote cat), offering extra grip in its high-speed pursuits. The ligament structure of the cheetah's claws is the same as those of other cats; it simply lacks the sheath of skin and fur present in other varieties, and therefore, with the exception of the dewclaw, the claws are always visible. The dewclaw is much shorter and straighter than that of other cats.Adaptations that enable the cheetah to run as fast as it does include large nostrils that allow for increased oxygen intake, and an enlarged heart and lungs that work together to circulate oxygen efficiently. During a typical chase, its respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute. While running, in addition to having good traction due to its semi-retractable claws, the cheetah uses its tail as a rudder-like means of steering to allow it to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank prey animals that often make such turns to escape.Unlike true big cats of subfamily Pantherinae, the cheetah can purr as it inhales, but cannot roar. By contrast, the big cats can roar but cannot purr, except while exhaling. The cheetah is still considered by some to be the smallest of the big cats. While it is often mistaken for the leopard, the cheetah does have distinguishing features, such as the aforementioned long \"tear-streak\" lines that run from the corners of its eyes to its mouth, and spots that are not \"rosettes\". The thinner body frame of the cheetah is also very different from that of the leopard. The cheetah is a vulnerable species. Of all the big cats, it is the least able to adapt to new environments. It has always proved difficult to breed in captivity, although recently a few zoos have managed to succeed at this. One technique has been to introduce a dog as a playmate and guard dog to enable a captive cheetah to feel less threatened.Once widely hunted for its fur, the cheetah now suffers more from the loss of both habitat and prey.The cheetah was formerly considered to be particularly primitive among the cats and to have evolved approximately 18 million years ago. However, new research suggests the last common ancestor of all 40 existing species of felines lived more recently than about 11 million years ago. The same research indicates that the cheetah, while highly derived morphologically, is not of particularly ancient lineage, having separated from its closest living relatives (Puma concolor, the cougar, and Puma yaguarondi, the jaguarundi) around five million years ago. These felids have not changed appreciably since they first appeared in the fossil record. Morphs and variations King cheetah The king cheetah is a rare mutation of the cheetah characterized by a distinct fur pattern. It was first noted in what was then Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) in 1926. In 1927, the naturalist Reginald Innes Pocock declared it a separate species, but reversed this decision in 1939 due to lack of evidence; but in 1928, a skin purchased by Walter Rothschild was found to be intermediate in pattern between the king cheetah and spotted cheetah and Abel Chapman considered it to be a color form of the spotted cheetah. Twenty-two such skins were found between 1926 and 1974. Since 1927, the king cheetah was reported five more times in the wild. Although strangely marked skins had come from Africa, a live king cheetah was not photographed until 1974 in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Cryptozoologists Paul and Lena Bottriell photographed one during an expedition in 1975. They also managed to obtain stuffed specimens. It appeared larger than a spotted cheetah and its fur had a different texture. There was another wild sighting in 1986\u2014the first in seven years. By 1987, thirty-eight specimens had been recorded, many from pelts.Its species status was resolved in 1981 when king cheetahs were born at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre in South Africa. In May 1981, two spotted sisters gave birth there and each litter contained one king cheetah. The sisters had both mated with a wild-caught male from the Transvaal area (where king cheetahs had been recorded). Further king cheetahs were later born at the Centre. It has been known to exist in Zimbabwe, Botswana and in the northern part of South Africa's Transvaal province.In 2012, the cause of this alternative coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep), the same gene responsible for the striped \"mackerel\" versus blotchy \"classic\" patterning seen in tabby cats. The mutation is recessive and must be inherited from both parents for this pattern to appear, which is one reason why it is so rare. Other color variationsOther rare color morphs of the species include speckles, melanism, albinism and gray coloration. Most have been reported in Indian cheetahs, particularly in captive specimens kept for hunting.The Mughal Emperor of India, Jahangir, recorded having a white cheetah presented to him in 1608. In the memoirs of Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, the Emperor, says that in the third year of his reign, \"Raja Bir Singh Deo brought a white cheetah to show me. Although other sorts of creatures, both birds and beasts have white varieties\u00a0... I had never seen a white cheetah. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a blue color, and the whiteness of the body also inclined to bluishness.\" This suggests a chinchilla mutation which restricts the amount of pigment on the hair shaft. Although the spots were formed of black pigment, the less dense pigmentation gives a hazy, grayish effect. As well as Jahangir's white cheetah at Agra, a report of \"incipient albinism\" has come from Beaufort West according to Guggisberg.In a letter to \"Nature in East Africa\", H. F. Stoneham reported a melanistic cheetah (black with ghost markings) in the Trans-Nzoia District of Kenya in 1925. Vesey Fitzgerald saw a melanistic cheetah in Zambia in the company of a spotted cheetah. Red (erythristic) cheetahs have dark tawny spots on a golden background. Cream (isabelline) cheetahs have pale red spots on a pale background. Some desert region cheetahs are unusually pale; probably they are better-camouflaged and therefore better hunters and more likely to breed and pass on their paler colouration. Blue (Maltese or grey) cheetahs have variously been described as white cheetahs with grey-blue spots (chinchilla) or pale grey cheetahs with darker grey spots (Maltese mutation). A cheetah with hardly any spots was shot in Tanzania in 1921 (Pocock); it had only a few spots on the neck and back, and these were unusually small. Another cheetah with this color-morph was photographed in Kenya in 2012."}, {"description": "The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large feline (family Felidae, subfamily Felinae) inhabiting most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the only extant member of the genus Acinonyx. The cheetah can run faster than any other land animal\u2014 as fast as 112 to 120\u00a0km/h (70 to 75\u00a0mph)Although according to Cheetah, Luke Hunter and Dave Hamman, (Struik Publishers, 2003), pp. 37\u201338, the cheetah's fastest recorded speed was 110 km/h. in short bursts covering distances up to 500 m (1,600\u00a0ft), and has the ability to accelerate from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in three seconds.The cheetah is a unique felid, with its closest living relatives being the puma and jaguarundi of the Americas. This cat is notable for modifications in the species' paws, being one of the few felids with only semi-retractable claws.Its main hunting strategy is to run down swift prey such as various antelope species and hares. Almost every facet of the cheetah's anatomy has evolved to maximise its success in the chase, the result of an evolutionary arms race with its prey. Due to this specialisation, however, the cheetah is poorly equipped to defend itself against other large predators, with speed being its main means of defence.In the wild, the cheetah is a prolific breeder, with up to nine cubs in a litter. The majority of cubs do not survive to adulthood, mainly as a result of depredation from other predators. The rate of cub mortality varies from area to area, from 50% to 75%,http://www.tigerhomes.org/animal/cheetah-facts.cfm and in extreme cases such as the Serengeti ecosystem, up to 90%. Cheetahs are notoriously poor breeders in captivity, though several organizations, such as the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre, have succeeded in breeding high numbers of cubs.The cheetah is listed as vulnerable, facing various threats including competition with and predation by other carnivores, a gene pool with very low variability, and persecution by mankind. It is a charismatic species and many captive cats are \"ambassadors\" for their species and wildlife conservation in general."}]}

The golden lion tamarin is the largest of the callitrichines. It is typically around 261 mm and weighs around 620 g. There is almost no size difference between males and females. As with all New World monkeys, the golden lion tamarin has tegulae, which are claw-like nails, instead of ungulae or flat nails found in all other primates, including humans. Tegulae enable tamarins to cling to the sides of tree trunks. It may also move quadrupedally along the small branches, whether through walking, running, leaping or bounding.Sussman RW.

Today, this tamarin is confined to three small areas of the tropical rain forest in southeastern Brazil: Po\u00e7o das Antas Biological Reserve, Fazenda Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve, private land through the Reintroduction Program. The first population estimate made in 1972 approximated the count at between 400 and 500. By 1981 the population was reduced to less than 200. Surveys from as recently as 1995 suggest that there may only be at most 400 golden lion tamarins left in the wild.

They can be found in hilltop forests and swamp forests."}, {"description": "Threats to the golden lion tamarin population include illegal logging, poaching, mining, urbanization and infrastructure development and the introduction of alien species. In 1969, the number of individuals in the Atlantic Forest was found to have dropped to a low of 150 individuals. In 1975 the golden lion tamarin was listed under Appendix I of CITES, given to animals threatened with extinction that may be or are being affected by trade. The species was listed as Endangered by the IUCN in 1982, and by 1984 the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. and the World Wide Fund for Nature, through the Golden Lion Tamarin Association, began a reintroduction programme from 140 zoos worldwide. Despite the success of the project, the IUCN classification rose to Critically Endangered in 1996. By 2003 the successful establishment of a new population at Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve enabled downgrading the species to endangered,Translocations of golden lion tamarins \u2013 history and status as of May 2006 but the IUCN warns that extreme habitat fragmentation from deforestation means the wild population has little potential for any further expansion. In an attempt to curb the golden lion tamarin's precipitous decline, several conservation programs have been undertaken. The intent is to strengthen the wild population and maintain a secure captive population in zoos worldwide. The survival rate of re-introduced animals has been encouraging, but destruction of unprotected habitat continues. Reintroduction Because of the extensive habitat loss of the golden lion tamarin, the wild population reached endangered status in the early 1980s. Beginning in 1983, there has been a huge effort on behalf of scientists and conservationists to reintroduce captive born golden lion tamarins back into the wild. With the help of the Brazilian government, conservationists established the Po\u00e7o das Antas Biological Reserve and the Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve as sites for reintroduction. The goals of the reintroduction process include increasing the size as well as the genetic diversity of the wild population, increasing the available range to better encompass the historic range of the tamarins in Brazil, and widening the scope of public awareness and education programs.Beck, B. Kleiman, D. Dietz, J. Castro, I. Carvalho, C. Martins, A. Rettberg-Beck, B. 1991. Losses and reproduction in reintroduced golden lion tamarins. Dodo , Journal of Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust 27: 50-61The first step of reintroduction begins with zoo free ranging programs, where tamarins have access to explore the entire zoo. However, they are kept on zoo grounds by the presence of a nest box, an ice box like container where their food is kept. When the tamarins are reintroduced in Po\u00e7o das Antas Biological Reserve, they require a large amount of post-release training and veterinary care. For the first 6\u201318 months the reintroduced groups are monitored. Additionally, 1-2 tamarins from each group are radio collared to allow careful monitoring, and all reintroduced tamarins are tattooed and dye marked for easy identification. Translocation Secondly, in an effort to save the golden lion tamarins from extinction, some of the golden lion tamarins have been removed from small, isolated unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve and Po\u00e7o das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden lion tamarins into Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991.Kleiman, D.G. and Rylands, A. B., Editors. 2002. Lion Tamarins: Biology and Conservation. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC (ISBN 1-58834-072-4) The golden lion tamarins faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.Cunningham, A. A. 1996. Disease risks of wildlife translocations. Conservation Biology 10:349-355 Despite the challenge of illness, the forty-two translocated golden lion tamarins' population grew to over 200 in Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve. The number of wild golden lion tamarins is now up in the thousands in all reserves and ranches combined in Brazil. These numbers were once down in the 200s in 1991. By 2025, the number of golden lion tamarins that are protected is projected to be greater than 2000. Effects of habitat lossGolden lion tamarins are native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Their original habitat was located from the southern part of the state of Rio de Janeiro to the southern part of the state of Espirito Santo. However, deforestation of Atlantic Forest for commercial purposes, predation, and capture of the golden lion tamarins for animal trade and sale as pets has limited their population to about five municipalities across Rio de Janeiro. Most of the population is now found in the Poco des Antas Biological Reserve in Rio de Janeiro.Cecilia, M., M. Kierulff, A. B. Rylands. 2003. Census and Distribution of the Golden Lion Tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia). American Journal of Primatology 59:29-44However, due to the deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic forest, their home ranges have decreased in size. The decrease in size has been reported in terms of fragmentation, and today the forest consists of thousands of fragments equaling only 8% of its former size.Tabarelli, M., W. Montovani, and C. A. Peres. 1999. Effects of habitat fragmentation on plant guild structure in the montane Atlantic forest of southeastern Brazil. Biol. Conserv. 91: 199\u2013127 This directly affects their areas of foraging and subsequently, the amount of resources available. Impact on juvenile behaviorThe habitat of the tamarins also has an impact on their behavior and social interactions. For example, the type of trees present has a significant effect on the behavior of juvenile golden lion tamarins. Their juvenile behavior is characterized by social play between individuals of different ages and species. This is a key aspect of their social, cognitive and motor skill development, and it influences their behavior when facing competition and predators; how they play mirrors the way they act when facing predatory or competitive interactions. Social play is observed more in large branches (>10\u00a0cm) and vine tangles (4m above ground), which is considered safe for them, as they are less vulnerable to predators, compared to play in the dangerous areas including canopy branches and the forest floor. Therefore, deforestation affects the diversity in the forest and decreases the \u201csafe\u201d areas for play for the juvenile tamarins. As a result, play decreases and therefore the development of learned survivorship behaviors does as well. Also, if play is observed in the dangerous areas, the individuals are more exposed to predators, leading to a population decline; which resembles the effect of predation on their sleeping sites. The exposure to predation not only affects the juvenile tamarins but the adults as well, since it has been observed that play happens in the center of the group for protection of the young.de Oliveira, Claudia R., Carlos R. Ruiz-Miranda, Devra G. Kleiman, and Benjamin B. Beck. \"Play behavior in juvenile golden lion tamarin (Callitrichidae: Primates): Organization in relation to costs.\" Ethology 109.7 (2003): 593-612. Web of Science Increase in inbreedingAdditionally, this deforestation and fragmentation also leads to demographic instabilities, and an increased probability of inbreeding, consequently leading to inbreeding depression and a population decline.Raboy, Becky E., Leonardo G. Neves, Sara Zeigler, Nicholas A. Saraiva, Nayara Cardoso, Gabriel Rodrigues Dos Santos, Jonathan D. Ballou, and Peter Leimgruber. \"Strength of Habitat and Landscape Metrics in Predicting Golden- Headed Lion Tamarin Presence or Absence in Forest Patches in Southern Bahia, Brazil.\" Biotropica 42.3 (2010): 388-97. Web of Science In the case of inbreeding, the problem lies in the increase of the isolated fragments where golden lion tamarins live. Inbreeding leads to low levels of genetic diversity and has a negative effect on survivorship; inbred offspring have a lower survivorship than non-bred offspring. Fragmentation leads to a decline in dispersal and as a result, a decline in breeding with individuals of other groups. Consequently, inbreeding depression is observed in these populations.Dietz JM, Baker AJ, Ballou JD. 2000. Demographic evidence of inbreeding depression in wild golden lion tamarins. In: Young AC, Clarke GM, editors. Genetics, demography, and viability of fragmented populations. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge Univ Pr. p 203-11 With delay breeding, the decrease and shortage of territory puts pressure on golden lion tamarins to disperse in order to find necessary resources and areas suitable for their survival. However, dispersal is risky and requires a lot of energy that could have been used for reproduction instead.Goldizen, Anne Wilson, and John Terborgh. \"Demography and Dispersal Patterns of a Tamarin Population: Possible Causes of Delayed Breeding.\" The American Naturalist 134.2 (1989): 208. Web of Science. Web. 9 Mar. 2013"}, {"description": "The golden lion tamarin is active for a maximum of 12 hours daily. It uses different sleeping dens each day.Kierulff MCM, Raboy BE, de Oliveira PP, Miller K, Passos FC, Prado F. (2002) \"Behavioral ecology of lion tamarins\". In: Kleiman DG, Rylands AB, editors.

(1997) \"Foraging ecology and use of space in wild golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia)\". Am J Primatol 41(4): 289-305. By frequently moving their sleeping nests around, groups minimize the scent left behind, reducing the likelihood of predators finding them. The first activities of the day are traveling and feeding on fruits. As the afternoon nears, tamarins focus more on insects. By late afternoon, they move to their night dens. Tamarin groups use hollow tree cavities, dense vines or epiphytes as sleeping sites. Sites that are between 11 and off the ground are preferred. The golden lion tamarin tends to be active earlier and retire later in the warmer, wetter times of the years as the days are longer. During drier times, it forages for insects longer as they become more scarce.Golden lion tamarins are characterized by using manipulative foraging under tree barks and epiphytic bromeliads. Their sites of foraging are usually distributed around their home ranges, which are large territories (averaging 123 hectares) in which multiple foraging sites are located, to find sufficient resources over long periods of time. These areas are sufficient enough in size so that even if there is overlap in between the home range of two different groups, the interactions are minimal due to the distribution of the foraging sites (they spend 50% of their time in approximately 11% of their home range).Raboy, Becky E., and James M. Dietz. \"Diet, foraging, and use of space in wild golden-headed lion tamarins.\" American Journal of Primatology 63.1 (2004): 1-15. Web of Science. Web. 9 Mar. 2013The golden lion tamarin has a diverse, omnivorous diet consisting of fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The golden lion tamarin uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as micromanipulation. It is made possible by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10\u201315% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, pulpy fruits. During the rainy season, the golden lion tamarin mainly eats fruit, however during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant. Social structure Golden lion tamarins are social and groups typically consist of 2-8 members. These groups usually consist of one breeding adult male and female but may also have 2\u20133 males and one female or the reverse.Dietz JM, Baker AJ. (1993) \"Polygyny and female reproductive success in golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia\". Anim Behav 46(6): 1067-78. Other members include subadults, juveniles and infants of either sexes. These individuals are typically the offspring of the adults. When there is more than one breeding adult in a group, one is usually dominant over the other and this is maintained through aggressive behavior. The dominance relationship between males and females depends on longevity in the group. A newly immigrated male is subordinate to the resident adult female who inherited her rank from her mother.Bales KL. (2000) Mammalian monogamy: dominance, hormones, and maternal care in wild golden lion tamarins. Ph.D dissertation, University of Maryland. Both males and females may leave their natal group at the age of four, however females may replace their mothers as the breeding adult, if they die, which will lead to the dispersal of the breeding male who is likely her father. This does not happen with males and their fathers. Dispersing males join groups with other males and remain in them until they find an opportunity to immigrate to a new group. The vast majority of recruits to groups are males.Baker AJ, Dietz JM. (1996) \"Immigration in wild groups of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia)\". Am J Primatol 38(1): 47-56. A male may find an opportunity to enter into a group when the resident male dies or disappears. Males may also aggressively displace resident males from their group; this is usually done by two immigrant males who are likely brothers. When this happens, only one of the new males will be able to breed and will suppress the reproduction of the other. A resident male may also leave a vacancy when his daughter becomes the breeding female and he must disperse to avoid inbreeding.Baker AJ, Bales K, Dietz JM.

Tamarins communicate though chemicals marked throughout their territories. Reproductive males and females scent mark the most and their non-reproductive counterparts rarely do so. Dominant males use scent marking to show their social status and may suppress the reproductive abilities of the other males. Reproduction The mating system of the golden lion tamarin is largely monogamous. When there are two adult males in a group only one of them will mate with the female. There are cases of a male mating with two females, usually a mother and daughter. Reproduction is seasonal and depends on rainfall. Mating is at its highest at the end of the rainy season between late March to mid-June and births peak during the September\u2013February rains.French JA, de Vleeschouwer K, Bales K, Hiestermann M. (2002) \"Lion tamarin reproductive biology\". In: Kleiman DG, Rylands AB, editors. Lion tamarins: biology and conservation. Washington DC: Smithsonian Inst Pr. Females are sexually mature between of 15\u201320 months but it isn't until they are 30 months old when they can reproduce. Only dominant females can reproduce and will suppress the reproduction of the other females in the group.French JA, Bales KL, Baker AJ, Dietz JM. (2003) \"Endocrine monitoring of wild dominant and subordinate female Leontopithecus rosalia\". Int J Primatol 24(6): 1281-1300. Males may reach puberty by 28 months. Tamarins have a four month gestation period. Golden lion tamarin groups exhibit cooperative rearing of the infants. This is due to the fact that tamarins commonly give birth to twins and, to a lesser extent, triplets and quadruplets. A mother is not able to provide for her litter and needs the help of the other members of the group.Tardif SD, Santos CV, Baker AJ, Van Elsacker L, Feistner ATC, Kleiman DG, Ruiz-Miranda CR, Moura AC de A, Passos FC, Price EC et al.

The younger members of the groups may lose breeding opportunities but they gain parental experience in helping to rear their younger siblings. In their first 4 weeks, the infants are completely dependent on their mother for nursing and carrying. By week five, the infants spend less time on their mother\u2019s back and begin to explore their surroundings. Young reach their juvenile stage at 17 weeks and will socialize other group members. The subadult phase is reached at 14 months and a tamarin first displays adult behaviors. Ecosystem rolesThe golden lion tamarin has a mutualistic interaction with 96 species of plants found in the Atlantic Forest. This interaction is based on seed dispersal and food sources for the tamarins. The tamarins show repeat visits to those plants with abundant resources. They tend to move around their territories, and therefore, seeds are dispersed to areas far from the parent shadow, which is ideal for germination. Their seed distribution is important to forest regeneration, and genetic variability and survival of endangered plant species.Janzantti Lapenta, Marina, and Paula Proc\u00f3pio-de-Oliveira. \"Some aspects of seed dispersal effectiveness of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest.\" Mongabay.com Open Access Journal 1.2 (2008): 129-139. Web of Science. Web. 9 Mar. 2013 PredationA study has shown that increased predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers.Hankerson, S. J., S.P Franklin, J.M. Dietz. 2007. Tree and forest characteristics influence sleeping site choice by golden lion tamarins. American Journal of Primatology 69:976-988 A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of golden lion tamarins to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. These predatory attacks occur at the golden lion tamarin sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the golden lion tamarins, sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most golden lion tamarins are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with a small percentage of canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the golden lion tamarins to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. Golden lion tamarins are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. Golden lion tamarins also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for golden lion tamarins to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the golden lion tamarin population.Franklin, S.P., K. E. Miller, A.

Tapirs mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths, which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.Exclusively herbivorous, the animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 115 species of plants (around 30 are particularly preferred), moving slowly through the forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. However, when threatened or frightened, the tapir can run quickly, despite its considerable bulk, and can also defend itself with its strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan tapirs communicate with high-pitched squeaks and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively nocturnal. They tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap in the middle of the night. This behavior characterizes them as crepuscular animals."}, {"description": "The animal is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its rear end. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration makes it more difficult to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than prey when it is lying down to sleep.Woodland Park Zoo Animal Fact Sheet: Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus) Malayan tapirs grow to between 1.8 and in length, not counting a stubby tail of only 5 to in length, and stand 90 to tall. They typically weigh between 250 and, although some adults can weigh up to 540 kg.Wilson & Burnie, Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK ADULT (2001), ISBN 978-0-7894-7764-4Tapirus indicus, Animal Diversity WebAsian Tapir, Arkive[1] The females are usually larger than the males. Like the other types of tapir, they have small, stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan tapir has rather poor eyesight, but excellent hearing and sense of smell.They have a large sagittal crest, a bone running along the middle of the skull that is necessary for muscle attachment. They also have unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with the frontal bones elevated, and a retracted nasal incision. All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull are, of course, to make room for the proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber. VisualMalayan tapirs have very poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their excellent sense of smell and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises on either side of their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark. Brevetianus variationA small number of melanistic (all-black) Malayan tapirs have been observed. In 1924, an all-black tapir was sent to Rotterdam Zoo and was classified as a subspecies called Tapirus indicus brevetianus after its discoverer, Captain K. Brevet.Shuker, Dr. Karl P. N. Mysteries of Planet Earth, pages 11-12 In 2000, two melanistic tapirs were observed during a study of tigers in the Jerangau Forest Reserve in Malaysia.Mohd, Azlan J. \"Recent Observations of Melanistic Tapirs in Peninsular Malaysia\". Tapir Conservation: The Newsletter of the IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group, June 2002, Volume 11, Number 1, pages 27-28 The cause of this variation may be a genetic abnormality similar to that of black panthers that appear in populations of spotted jaguars. However, unless and until more T. i. brevetianus individuals can be studied, the precise explanation for the trait will remain unknown."}, {"description": "The Malayan tapir was once found throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. However, its numbers have decreased in recent years, and today, like all tapirs, it is in danger of extinction.Database entry includes justification for why this species is vulnerable Because of their size, tapirs have few natural predators, and even reports of killings by tigers are scarce.bin Momin Khan, Mohd Khan. \"Status and Action Plan of the Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus)\" Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan published by IUCN Tapir Specialist Group, 1997, page 2 The main threat to the Malayan tapirs is human activity, including deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade.Fact sheet on Malayan Tapir - Tapirus indicus, UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, in association with the World Wildlife Foundation In Thailand, for instance, capture and sale of a young tapir may be worth US$5500.00. In areas such as Sumatra, where the population is predominantly Muslim, tapirs are seldom hunted for food, as their physical similarity to pigs has made tapir meat a taboo, but in some regions they are hunted for sport or shot accidentally when mistaken for other animals.Simon, Tamar. \u201cThe Tapir: A Big Unknown\u201d article from Discovery Channel Canadian website, July 22, 1999. Protected status in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, which seeks to curb deliberate killing of tapirs but does not address the issue of habitat loss, has had limited effect in reviving or maintaining the population."}, {"description": "The gestation period of the Malayan tapir is about 390\u2013395 days, after which a single offspring, weighing around 15 pounds (6.8\u00a0kg), is born.

Retrieved June 16, 2006. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity."}, {"description": "Der Schabrackentapir oder Malaysischer Tapir (Tapirus indicus) ist eine S\u00e4ugetierart aus der Familie der Tapire (Tapiridae).

Tags\u00fcber zieht er sich ins dichte Unterholz zur\u00fcck und ist nur gelegentlich zu beobachten.Jeremy Holden: Indonesia. Tapir Conservation 11 (1), 2002, S. 20. Er ist ein guter Kletterer und kann au\u00dferdem ausgezeichnet schwimmen und tauchen. Dabei lebt die Tapirart in der Regel einzelg\u00e4ngerisch; Gruppenbildungen finden nur w\u00e4hrend der Brunftzeit statt oder umfassen Muttertiere mit ihren K\u00e4lbern. Die Vertreter des Schabrackentapirs unterhalten Reviere, sind aber nicht streng territorial. M\u00e4nnliche Tiere haben Reviergr\u00f6\u00dfen von 1 bis 2 km\u00b2, weibliche wohl etwas ausgedehntere. In manchen F\u00e4llen konnten Territorien einzelner Individuen mit bis zu 12 km\u00b2 Gr\u00f6\u00dfe festgestellt werden. In den einzelnen Territorien, die sich mit denen anderer Tapire \u00fcberlappen k\u00f6nnen, legt der Schabrackentapir auf seinen Wanderungen zu den verschiedenen Aktivit\u00e4tszonen, wie Fress-, Schwimm- oder Rastpl\u00e4tzen, Trampelpfade im Unterholz an und markiert diese mit Kot und Urin. Allerdings ist auch bekannt, dass der Schabrackentapir seine F\u00e4kalien h\u00e4ufig in Gew\u00e4ssern entsorgt. Das Verspritzen von Urin, welches h\u00e4ufig mit einem charakteristischen Scharren der F\u00fc\u00dfe einhergeht, gilt auch als wichtiges Kommunikationsmittel zwischen Artgenossen. Ern\u00e4hrungBadende Schabrackentapire Der Schabrackentapir ist ein Pflanzenfresser, der sich von weicher Pflanzenkost wie Bl\u00e4ttern, Wasserpflanzen und Zweigen ern\u00e4hrt. Er nutzt dabei B\u00fcsche, niedrig wachsende B\u00e4ume, teilweise aber auch Kletterpflanzen. Die Bevorzugung derartiger Pflanzennahrung zeigt sich auch in seiner Anatomie, wie den Backenz\u00e4hnen mit ihrer geringen H\u00f6he der Zahnkronen und den Schmelzh\u00f6ckern und -leisten, die eine Anpassung an diese Ern\u00e4hrungsweise darstellen, ebenso wie der R\u00fcssel. Mit diesem ergreift das Tier entfernte Nahrung und bef\u00f6rdert sie in das Maul. Bei der Nahrungssuche bewegt er sich mit dem R\u00fcssel am Boden vorw\u00e4rts, oft in zick-zack-f\u00f6rmigen Routen. Es sind mehr als 110 Pflanzenarten dokumentiert, die vom Schabrackentapir verzehrt werden. Dazu geh\u00f6ren vor allem Teestrauch-, R\u00f6te- und Wolfsmilchgew\u00e4chse, ebenso aber auch Kreuzdorngew\u00e4chse und h\u00e4ufig auch Vertreter der pantropischen Pflanzengruppe Phyllanthaceae. Dabei verbreitet er auch als bevorzugter Fr\u00fcchtefresser bei seinen Wanderungen durch Ausscheidungen die aufgenommenen Pflanzensamen weiter und stellt so einen wichtigen \u00f6kologischen Faktor dar. Davon profitieren vor allem die Pflanzen mit kleinen Samen, wie etwa der Indische Rosenapfel, der in rund einem Drittel aller Dungproben nachgewiesen wurde, w\u00e4hrend Gew\u00e4chse mit gr\u00f6\u00dferen Samen, so der Cempedak, eher selten nachgewiesen werden.Nor Zalipah Mohamed und Carl Traeholt: A Preliminary Study of Habitat Selection by Malayan Tapir, Tapirus indicus, in Krau Wildlife Reserve, Malaysia.

Die Fortpflanzungsrate ist wie bei allen Tapiren relativ gering, zwischen den Geburten liegt ein Intervall von knapp zwei Jahren. Die Brunft des weiblichen Tieres findet alle 29 bis 31 Tage statt. In dieser Zeit werben die M\u00e4nnchen um das Weibchen, der Geschlechtsakt beginnt mit dem Aufsitzen des m\u00e4nnlichen auf dem weiblichen Tier.Nach einer Tragzeit von rund 390 bis 394 Tagen bringt das Weibchen in der Regel ein einzelnes Jungtier zur Welt, Zwillinge sind \u00e4u\u00dferst selten und k\u00f6nnen in einem Abstand von mehreren Tagen geboren werden. Ein neugeborener Schabrackentapir ist wie alle Tapirk\u00e4lber br\u00e4unlich gef\u00e4rbt und tr\u00e4gt ein helles Streifen- oder Fleckenmuster, das der Tarnung dient. Das Jungtier wiegt zwischen neun und zehn Kilogramm. Die ersten Lebenstage verbringt es in einem gesch\u00fctzten Lager, danach folgt es der Mutter bei ihren Streifz\u00fcgen und beginnt auch schon Pflanzennahrung zu sich zu nehmen. Allerdings saugt das Kalb auch noch Milch, wobei die gebrauchte Menge bis zu 9 l am Tag betr\u00e4gt. Der anf\u00e4ngliche t\u00e4gliche Gewichtszuwachs eines jungen Schabrackentapirs liegt bei knapp 1 kg pro Tag.Frank Brandst\u00e4tter: Successful Breeding of the Malay Tapir (Tapirus indicus) at Dortmund Zoo, Germany, with a \u201cProblem\u201d Female.

Interaktionen mit anderen TierartenDer Schabrackentapir ist generell sehr scheu und vorsichtig, im Bedrohungsfall verharrt er regungslos oder zieht sich ins Wasser zur\u00fcck. Ger\u00e4t ein Tier aber in Panik, l\u00e4uft es blindlings durchs Geb\u00fcsch. Wenn notwendig, verteidigt sich der Schabrackentapir mit Bissen seines kr\u00e4ftigen Vordergebisses. Nur selten verh\u00e4lt sich der Schabrackentapir gegen\u00fcber Menschen aggressiv.Wolfgang Puschmann: Zootierhaltung. Tiere in menschlicher Obhut. S\u00e4ugetiere Wissenschaftlicher Verlag Harri Deutsch, Frankfurt/M. 2004, S. 599. Zu den nat\u00fcrlichen Feinden geh\u00f6rt weitgehend der Tiger, der als guter Schwimmer bef\u00e4higt ist, einen fl\u00fcchtigen Schabrackentapir auch ins Wasser zu verfolgen. Inwiefern die Tapirart tats\u00e4chlich vom Tiger bejagt wird, ist weitgehend unklar. Neuere Langzeituntersuchungen im Kerinchi-Seblat-Nationalpark ergaben nur einen geringen Jagddruck des Tigers auf den Schabrackentapir, so dass dieser nicht zum bevorzugten Beutespektrum der Gro\u00dfkatze geh\u00f6rt. Da das Raubtier \u00fcberwiegend tags\u00fcber auf Beutezug geht, \u00fcberschneiden sich weiterhin die Aktivit\u00e4tszyklen der beiden Tierarten kaum, sondern wechseln sich weitgehend ab.M. Linkie und M. S. Ridout: Assessing tiger\u2013prey interactions in Sumatran rainforests. Journal of Zoology 284, 2011, S. 224\u2013229.

Die Augen sind klein, die Ohren oval, aufgerichtet und nicht sehr beweglich. Vor allem am Nacken und an Hinterteil ist die Haut sehr dick ausgebildet.Mohd Khan bin Momin Khan: Status and Action Plan of the Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus).

Die vordere H\u00e4lfte des K\u00f6rpers und die Hinterbeine sind schwarz, der hintere Rumpf ist wei\u00df. Dieses Muster ist eine wirkungsvolle Tarnung, da der Tapir sich im Dunkel des Regenwaldes gegen seinen Hintergrund nur teilweise abhebt und potentielle R\u00e4uber die Tapirart nicht erkennen.

Sch\u00e4del- und GebissmerkmaleSch\u00e4del des Schabrackentapirs (Sammlung Museum Wiesbaden) Der Sch\u00e4del des Schabrackentapirs wird bis zu 41 cm lang und ist relativ schmal, allerdings weniger schmal als der des Mittelamerikanischen Tapirs (Tapirus bairdii). Er ist flach geformt und besitzt einige Anpassungen an die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Tieres, wie etwa eine luftgef\u00fcllte, deutlich vergr\u00f6\u00dferte Stirnh\u00f6hle, welche die Oberfl\u00e4che f\u00fcr Muskelansatzstellen erweitert und gleichzeitig das Gewicht reduziert.Matthew Colbert: Tapirus indicus, Asian Tapir. The University of Texas at Austin ([2]) Ein Scheitelkamm wie bei den s\u00fcdamerikanischen Tapirarten Flachland- (Tapirus terrestris) und Bergtapir (Tapirus pinchaque) ist nicht ausgebildet. Vielmehr besitzt der Schabrackentapir, analog zum Mittelamerikanischen Tapir, seitlich ansetzende Knochenerhebungen (parasagittale R\u00fccken), die eine schmale, aber flache Ebene auf dem Kopf formen.Luke T. Holbrook: The unusual development of the sagittal crest in the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Journal of Zoology 256, 2002, S. 215\u2013219. Das Hinterhauptsbein weist eine kurze und rechtwinklige Form auf, der Hinterhauptswulst ist in der Aufsicht deutlich eingesattelt. Das Nasenbein, welches wie bei den anderen Tapiren weit hinter dem Zwischenkieferknochen liegt, ist sehr kurz und verl\u00e4uft gerade. Die Reduktion des Nasenbeins und einiger anderer Knochen des Gesichtes entstand aus der Entwicklung des charakteristischen R\u00fcssels, der eine Bildung aus Nase und Oberlippe darstellt.Luke T.

Das wie bei den anderen Tapiren kaum reduzierte Gebiss besitzt bei erwachsenen Individuen folgende Zahnformel: \\frac{3.1.4.3}{3.1.3.3}. Im vorderen Gebiss sind die jeweils \u00e4u\u00dferen Schneidez\u00e4hne des Oberkiefers (I3) vergr\u00f6\u00dfert und konisch geformt, w\u00e4hrend alle anderen eine stark verminderte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe besitzen. Daf\u00fcr ist wiederum der Eckzahn des Unterkiefers deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer und steht dem dritten Schneidezahn des Oberkiefers gegen\u00fcber, so dass beide ein effektives Bei\u00dfwerkzeug darstellen. Der Oberkiefereckzahn dagegen ist verkleinert. Ein kleines Diastema trennt Schneide- und Eckz\u00e4hne, ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes die Eckz\u00e4hne vom hinteren Gebiss. Die Pr\u00e4molaren und Molaren besitzen einen weitgehend \u00fcbereinstimmenden Aufbau. Sie sind niederkronig (brachyodont) und weisen zwei Zahnschmelzfalten auf der Kaufl\u00e4che (bilophodont) auf, die an den Enden durch Schmelzh\u00f6cker leicht erh\u00f6ht sind.Richard C.

Sinnesleistungen und Laut\u00e4u\u00dferungenDer Schabrackentapir besitzt wie alle Tapire einen wenig ausgebildeten Sehsinn, im Nahbereich stellt dieser aber dennoch eine wichtige Kommunikationshilfe dar. Dabei reagieren die Tiere auf bestimmte Schl\u00fcsselreize, wie die wei\u00dfen Ohrspitzen, den R\u00fcssel, aber auch auf die schwarze und wei\u00dfe Fellzeichnung besonders deutlich und beginnen unmittelbar zu schn\u00fcffeln, zu flehmen oder auch durch Urin ihr Revier zu markieren.Susanne Zenzinger: Experimentelle Untersuchungen zur optischen Kommunikation bei im Zoo gehaltenen Schabracken- und Flachlandtapiren (Tapirus indicus und Tapirus terrestris). Der Zoologische Garten N.F. 79, 2010, S. 162\u2013174. Besonders wichtig sind aber das Geh\u00f6r und der Geruchssinn. Vor allem auf akustische Reize reagiert der Schabrackentapir schnell, wobei Artgenossen und m\u00f6gliche Fressfeinde die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Reizfunktion haben. Die Lautkommunikation erfolgt \u00fcber bisher sechs bekannte Lautarten, die ausgesto\u00dfen werden. Dazu geh\u00f6ren Pfeif- und Jaulger\u00e4usche, zwei verschiedene Quiekt\u00f6ne und zwei Laute, die an ein R\u00fclpsen beziehungsweise Glucksen erinnern. Alle diese Ger\u00e4usche weisen verschiedene Variationen und Zeitdauer auf und k\u00f6nnen auch kombiniert vorkommen. H\u00e4ufig werden diese T\u00f6ne vor der Nahrungsaufnahme abgegeben, zumindest das Jaulen steht m\u00f6glicherweise direkt mit dem Fressen in Verbindung, w\u00e4hrend bei den anderen Ger\u00e4uschen der Grund bisher unbekannt ist; m\u00f6glicherweise dienen sie aber zur Kontaktaufnahme. Bedeutend sind dabei die disharmonischen R\u00fclps- und Glucksger\u00e4usche, die meist niederfrequente Wellenbereiche umfassen und im Lebensraum des tropischen Regenwaldes wesentlich weiter getragen werden als die h\u00f6herfrequenten Quiek- und Jault\u00f6ne. Insgesamt ist die Lautkommunikation des Schabrackentapirs aber wenig erforscht.Pernille Johansen Naundrup: Vocal behaviour and communication of the Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus).

It ranges from the southern half of the continental United States through most of Mexico, and through most of Central America into South America. The range of the Mexican free-tailed bat in South America is less understood where it lives in the eastern Brazilian highlands and coast, the northeastern Andes and the coast of Peru and northern Chile. It is absent in much of the Amazon rainforest. The bat is also found in the Caribbean, and is native to all of the Greater Antilles and 11 of the Lesser Antilles.Baker, R. J., Genoways, H. H. 1978. Zoogeography of Antillean bats. In. Zoogeography in the Caribbean, ed. F. B. Gill pp. 53-97. Philadelphia: Acad The largest known colony is found at Bracken Cave, north of San Antonio, Texas, with nearly 20 million bats; research indicates the bats from this colony congregate in huge numbers at altitudes between 180 and 1,000 m (590 and 3,300\u00a0ft), and even as high as 3,000 m (9,800\u00a0ft). HabitatMexican free-tailed bats roost primarily in caves. However, they will also roost in buildings of any type as long as they have access to openings and dark recesses in ceilings or walls.Wilkins, K. (1989). \"Tadarida brasiliensis\". Mammalian Species , 331: 1-10. The bats can make roosting sites of buildings regardless of \"age, height, architecture, construction materials, occupancy by humans and compass orientation\". Caves, on the other hand, need to have enough wall and ceiling space to fit millions of bats. Before buildings, free-tailed bats in the southeastern United States probably roosted in the hollows of trees such as red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove and cypress. However, most bats in Florida seem to prefer buildings and other man-made structures over natural roosts. Caves in Florida tend to be occupied mostly by the southeastern myotis. Caves in Florida tend to have pools of water on the floor and the free-tailed bats do not need as much relative humidity as the southeastern myotis. Migration Mexican free-tailed bats in southeastern Nevada, southwestern Utah, western Arizona and southeastern California come together to migrate southwest to southern California and Baja California. Bats in southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, western New Mexico and eastern Arizona travel though western edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental into Jalisco, Sinaloa and Sonora. Some bats that summer in Kansas, Oklahoma, eastern New Mexico and Texas will migrate southward to southern TexasGlass BP (1982) Seasonal movements of Mexican free- tail bats Tadarida brasiliensis mextcana banded in the Great Plains. Southwestern Nat., 27:127-133. and Mexico. Some bat populations in other areas of North America do not migrate, but are residents and may make seasonal changes in roost sites. In Austin, Texas, a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats summers (they winter in Mexico) under the Congress Avenue Bridge ten blocks south of the Texas State Capitol. It is the largest urban colony in North America, with an estimated 1,500,000 bats. Each night they eat 10000 to of insects. Each year they attract 100,000 tourists who come to watch them. In Houston, Texas, a colony is living under the Waugh Street Bridge over Buffalo Bayou. It is the home to 250,000 bats and also attracts viewers. The Mexican free-tailed bat is the official \"flying mammal\" of the state of Texas.Bats ranging eastward from East Texas do not migrate, but local shifts in roost usage often occur seasonally. Also, a regional population that ranges from Oregon to California, has a year-round residence. DietMexican free-tailed bats are primarily insectivores. They hunt their prey using echolocation. The bats eat moths, beetles, dragonflies, flies, true bugs, wasps, and ants. Bats usually catch flying prey in flight.McWilliams, L. 2005. Variation in diet of the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana). Journal of Mammalogy, 86/3: 599-605. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats fly hundreds of meters above the ground in Texas to feed on migrating insects.Gary F. McCracken, Erin H. Gillam, John K. Westbrook, Ya-Fu Lee, Michael L. Jensen and Ben B. Balsley (2008) \"Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis: Molossidae, Chiroptera) at high altitude: links to migratory insect populations\", Integrative and Comparative Biology 48(1):107-118. The consumption of insects by these bats can be quite significant.[1] Do Bats Control Mosquitoes?[2] Animal Fact Sheet: Mexican Free-Tailed Bat, Desert MuseumAdditionally, Mexican free-tailed bats are also efficient pollinators. Their pollination of sugar cane as well as their consumption of insects that damage sugar cane may be among the reasons why Bacardi rum features the Mexican free-tailed bat as its icon. Bacardi Ltd. themselves attribute the use of the bat in the logo to, \"...\u00a0Don Facundo\u2019s wife, Amalia, who suggested using a bat for the company logo. It was an insightful choice, because according to Cuban and Spanish lore, bats symbolize good health, good fortune and family unity.\"[3] Bacardi Ltd.

Bats of Puerto Rico. Jamaica: The University of the West Indies Press. Predators of the bat include large birds such as red-tailed hawk, American kestrels, great horned owls, barn owls, and Mississippi kites. Mammal predators include Virginia opossums, striped skunks, and raccoons. Snakes such as eastern coachwhips and eastern coral snakes may also prey on them, but at a lesser extent. Certain types of beetles prey on neonate and juvenile bats that have fallen to the ground. This species seems to have a low incidence of rabies, at least in the United States. They do, however, contain certain pesticides."}, {"description": "Though abundant and widespread, some local populations have prompted protection and conservation efforts. For instance, during the spring and summer, one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat populations inhabits Cueva de la Boca, a cave near Monterrey, Mexico. In 2006, the Mexican environmental conservation NGO, Pronatura Noreste, purchased the property. Because of a reduction of more than 95% of the original 20 million bat population, as a result of vandalism, pollution, and uncontrolled tourism, the organization decided to buy the property to place it under conservation. Other species of high ecological value that inhabit the cavern are also being protected."}, {"description": "Mexican free-tailed bats are about 9 cm in length, and they weigh about 12.3 g. Their tails make up almost half their lengths. Their ears are wide and set apart to help them find prey with echolocation. They are also fairly close behind the snout and eyes. Their fur color varies from dark brown to gray. Their muzzles are condensed, with wrinkled upper lips. The tail of these bats stretches further than the uropatagium, hence they are named \"free-tailed\" bats. The wings are elongated and narrow with pointed tips, making them well-equipped for quick, straight flight patterns."}, {"description": "Mexican free-tailed bats are nocturnal foragers and begin feeding after dusk.

Journal of Comparative Physiology, 179: 315\u2013323. EcholocationMexican free-tailed bats use echolocation for navigation and detecting prey. Traveling calls are of a brief but constant frequency. However, they switch modulated frequency calls between 40 and 75\u00a0kHz if they detect something.Gillam, E., G. McCracken. 2007. Variability in the echolocation of Tadarida brasiliensis: effects. Animal Behavior, 74: 277-286. Typically, the frequency range of their echolocation is between 49 and 70\u00a0kHz, but can be between 25 and 40\u00a0kHz if something crosses their path while in flight.On 6 November 2014, Aaron Corcoran, a biologist at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, reported online in Science that he and his team had detected Mexican free-tailed bats emitting ultrasonic vocalizations which had the effect of jamming the echolocation calls of a rival bat species hunting moths. The \u2018jamming\u2019 call led to an increased chance of the rival missing its prey, which the Mexican free-tailed bat was then able to eat itself. Earlier researchers had discovered some 15 types of social calls made by Mexican free-tailed bats and reported that they could adjust their calls to avoid interfering with others in range of their calls. Mating and reproduction During the breeding season, females aggregate into maternity roosts. The size of these roosts depends on the environment, with caves having the larger roosts. Mating can occur in an aggressive or passive form. In the aggressive form, the male controls the female's movements, keeping her away from the other bats in the roost.Keeley, A., B. Keeley. 2004. The Mating System of Tadarida brasiliensis (Chiroptera: Molossidae) in a Large Highway Bridge Colony. Journal of Mammalogy, 85/1: 113-1. He also tends to vocalize when mating. During passive copulation, the males simply flies to a female in her roost and quietly mounts her with no resistance. This species is a promiscuous breeder and both sexes copulate with multiple partners. Females become sexually mature at about 9 months, while males take even longer, at two years. Females enter estrus once a year, which typically lasts five weeks in the spring. The gestation period of the bat lasts 11\u201312 weeks, with only one young being born. A number of pups are left in \"creches\", while their mothers roost elsewhere. The female uses vocalizations and scent to identify her pup. The mother imprints her scent on the young early on.Loughry, W., G. McCracken. 1991. Factors influencing female-pup scent recognition in Mexican free-tailed bats. Journal of Mammalogy, 72/3: 624-626.

Excavations in Alby, Sweden, adjacent to the Stora Alvaret have yielded moose antlers in wooden hut remains from 6000\u00a0BCE, indicating some of the earliest moose hunting in northern Europe. In northern Scandinavia one can still find remains of trapping pits used for hunting moose. These pits, which can be up to 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0m wide and 2\u00a0m deep, would have been camouflaged with branches and leaves. They would have had steep sides lined with planks, making it impossible for the moose to escape once it fell in. The pits are normally found in large groups, crossing the moose's regular paths and stretching over several kilometers. Remains of wooden fences designed to guide the animals toward the pits have been found in bogs and peat. In Norway, an early example of these trapping devices has been dated to around 3,700\u00a0BC. Trapping elk in pits is an extremely effective hunting method, and as early as the 16th\u00a0century the Norwegian government tried to restrict their use. Nevertheless, the method was in use until the 19th\u00a0century.The earliest recorded description of the moose is in Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, where it is described thus:There are also [animals], which are called moose. The shape of these, and the varied color of their skins, is much like roes, but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with them. In book 8, chapter 16 of Pliny the Elder's Natural History from 77\u00a0AD the elk and an animal called achlis, which is presumably the same animal, are described thus: ...there is, also, the moose, which strongly resembles our steers, except that it is distinguished by the length of the ears and of the neck. There is also the achlis, which is produced in the land of Scandinavia; it has never been seen in this city, although we have had descriptions of it from many persons; it is not unlike the moose, but has no joints in the hind leg. Hence, it never lies down, but reclines against a tree while it sleeps; it can only be taken by previously cutting into the tree, and thus laying a trap for it, as otherwise, it would escape through its swiftness. Its upper lip is so extremely large, for which reason it is obliged to go backwards when grazing; otherwise, by moving onwards, the lip would get doubled up. As food Moose are hunted as a game species in many of the countries where they are found. Moose meat tastes, wrote Henry David Thoreau in \u201cThe Maine Woods\u201d, \u201clike tender beef, with perhaps more flavour; sometimes like veal\u201d. While the flesh has protein levels similar to those of other comparable red meats (e.g. beef, deer and elk), it has a low fat content, and the fat that is present consists of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats. Moose have been bred with cattle in the past for food.Cadmium levels are high in Finnish elk liver and kidneys, with the result that consumption of these organs from elk more than one year old is prohibited in Finland. Cadmium intake has been found to be elevated amongst all consumers of elk meat, though the elk meat was found to contribute only slightly to the daily cadmium intake. However the consumption of moose liver or kidneys significantly increased cadmium intake, with the study revealing that heavy consumers of moose organs have a relatively narrow safety margin below the levels which would probably cause adverse health effects.Vahteristo, L., Lyytik\u00e4inen, T., Ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen, E. R., Eskola, M., Lindfors, E., Pohjanvirta, R., & Maijala, R. (2003). Cadmium intake of moose hunters in Finland from consumption of moose meat, liver and kidney. Food Additives and Contamination, 20, 453\u2013463.Dr. Valerius Geist, who emigrated to Canada from the Soviet Union, wrote in his 1999 book Moose: Behaviour, Ecology, Conservation: Boosting of moose populations in Alaska for hunting purposes is one of the reasons given for allowing aerial or airborne methods to remove wolves in designated areas, e.g., Craig Medred: \"A kill of 124 wolves would thus translate to [the survival of] 1488 moose or 2976 caribou or some combination thereof\".[1] Many scientists believe that this artificial inflation of game populations is actually detrimental to both caribou and moose populations as well as the ecosystem as a whole. This is because studies have shown that when these game populations are artificially boosted, it leads to both habitat destruction and a crash in these populations.Aerial Hunting FAQs, Protect America\u2019s Wildlife (PAW) Act Vehicle collisions A moose's body structure, with a large heavy body suspended on long spindly legs, makes these animals particularly dangerous when hit by passenger cars with low ground clearances. Generally, when colliding with a moose at high speed, the car's bumper and front grille will break the moose's legs, causing the body of the moose to fall onto the car's hood and delivering the bulk of the animal's weight into the windshield, crushing the front roof support beams and anyone in the front seats.http://www.vti.se/sv/publikationer/pdf/algdocka-av-gummi-for-krockprov.pdf Collisions of this type are frequently lethal; seatbelts offer no protection, and airbags may not deploy or be of much use if they do.Traffic Management for a Sustainable Environment Number 2, 2004, of Nordic Road & Transport Research. Annotations Sweden Although vehicles with higher clearances (such as trucks) are typically immune from this effect, the force of striking any 270+ kg (600+ pound) object at high speed should not be underestimated. These risks led to the development of a vehicle test referred to as the \"moose test\" (, ).Moose warning signs are used on roads in regions where there is a danger of collision with the animal. The triangular warning signs common in Sweden, Norway, and Finland have become coveted souvenirs among tourists traveling in these countries, causing the road authorities so much expense that the moose signs have been replaced with image-less generic warning signs in some regions.\"\u00c4lgsafari lockar tusentals turister\", Dagens Nyheter, August 12, 2007. Accessed November 6, 2009.\"In January 2008, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten estimated that some 13,000 moose had died in collisions with Norwegian trains since 2000. The state agency in charge of railroad infrastructure (Jernbaneverket) plans to spend 80 million Norwegian kroner to reduce collision rate in the future by fencing the railways, clearing vegetation from near the tracks, and providing alternative snow-free feeding places for the animals elsewhere.In the Canadian province of New Brunswick, collisions with moose are frequent enough that all new highways have fences to prevent moose from accessing the road, as has long been done in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A demonstration project, Highway\u00a07 between Fredericton and Saint John, which has one of the highest frequencies of moose collisions in the province, did not have these fences until 2008, although it was and continues to be extremely well signed.Moose-Vehicle Collision Information, New Brunswick Department of TransportationMore wildlife fencing to be installed on Route 7 in 2008, Communications New Brunswick, April 8, 2008 Newfoundland and Labrador recommended that motorists use caution between dusk and dawn because that is when moose are most active and most difficult to see, increasing the risk of collisions.

Retrieved on 2011-01-09.In eastern Germany, where the scarce population is slowly increasing, there were two road accidents involving moose since 2000. Domestication Domestication of moose was investigated in the Soviet Union before World War II. Early experiments were inconclusive, but with the creation of an moose-farm at Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve in 1949 a small-scale moose domestication program was started, involving attempts at selective breeding of animals on the basis of their behavioural characteristics. Since 1963, the program has continued at Kostroma Moose Farm, which had a herd of 33 tame moose as of 2003. Although at this stage the farm is not expected to be a profit-making enterprise, it obtains some income from the sale of moose milk and from visiting tourist groups. Its main value, however, is seen in the opportunities it offers for the research in the physiology and behavior of the moose, as well as in the insights it provides into the general principles of animal domestication.In Sweden, there was a debate in the late 18th century about the national value of using the moose as a domestic animal. Among other things, the moose was proposed to be used in postal distribution, and there was a suggestion to develop a moose-mounted cavalry. Such proposals remained unimplemented, mainly because the extensive hunting for moose that was deregulated in the 1790s nearly drove it to extinction. While there has been documented cases of individual moose being used for riding and/or pulling carts and sleds, Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6f concludes no wide-scale usage has occurred outside fairytales.Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6f, Sune.

Like its relatives, Odocoileus and Capreolus, the genus Alces gave rise to very few species that endured for long periods of time. This differs from the Megacerines, such as the Irish elk, which evolved many species before going extinct. Some scientists, such as Adrian Lister, grouped all the species into one genus, while others, such as Augusto Azzaroli, used Alces for the living species, placing the fossil species into the genera Cervalces and Libralces.The earliest known species is Libralces gallicus (French moose), which lived in the Pliocene epoch, about 2 million years ago. Libralces gallicus came from the warm savannahs of Pliocene Europe, with the best preserved skeletons being found in southern France. L. gallicus was 1.25 times larger than the Alaskan moose in linear dimensions, making it nearly twice as massive. L. gallicus had many striking differences from its modern descendants. It had a longer, narrower snout and a less-developed nasal cavity, more resembling that of a modern deer, lacking any sign of the modern moose-snout. Its face resembled that of the modern wapiti. However, the rest of its skull structure, skeletal structure and teeth bore strong resemblance to those features that are unmistakable in modern moose, indicating a similar diet. Its antlers consisted of a horizontal bar 2-1/2 meters long, with no tines, ending in small palmations. Its skull and neck structure suggest an animal that fought using high-speed impacts, much like the Dall sheep, rather than locking and twisting antlers the way modern moose combat. Their long legs and bone structure suggest an animal that was adapted to running at high speeds over rough terrain.Deer of the world: their evolution, behaviour, and ecology By Valerius Geist - Page 244-250Morphological Change in Quaternary Mammals of North America By Robert Allen Martin, Anthony D. Barnosky - Cambridge University Press 1993 Page 178-181Libralces existed until the middle Pleistocene epoch and were followed briefly by a species called Cervalces carnutorum. The main differences between the two consisted of shortening of the horizontal bar in the antlers and broadening of the palmations, indicating a likely change from open plains to more forested environments, and skeletal changes that suggest an adaptation to marshy environments.Cervalces carnutorum was soon followed by a much larger species called Cervalces latifrons (broad-fronted stag-moose). The Pleistocene epoch was a time of gigantism, in which most species were much larger than their descendants of today, including exceptionally large lions, hippopotamuses, mammoths, and deer. Many fossils of Cervalces latifrons have been found in Siberia, dating from about 1.2 to 0.5 million years ago. This is most likely the time at which the species migrated from the Eurasian continent to North America. Like its descendants, it inhabited mostly northern latitudes, and was probably well-adapted to the cold. Cervalces latifrons was the largest deer known to have ever existed, standing more than 2.1 meters tall at the shoulders. This is bigger than even the Irish elk (megacerine), which was 1.8 meters tall at the shoulders. Its antlers were smaller than the Irish elk's, but comparable in size to those of Libralces gallicus. However, the antlers had a shorter horizontal bar and larger palmations, more resembling those of a modern moose.Alces alces (the modern moose) appeared during the late Pleistocene epoch. The species arrived in North America at the end of the Pleistocene and coexisted with a late-surviving variety or relative of Cervalces latifrons, which Azzaroli classified as a separate species called Cervalces scotti, or the American stag-moose.The evolution of artiodactyls By Donald R.

Brown bears are also known to prey on moose, although bears are more likely to take over a wolf kill or to take young moose than to hunt adult moose on their own. American black bears and cougars can be significant predators of moose calves in May and June and can, in rare instances, predate adults (mainly cows). Wolverine are most likely to eat moose as carrion but have killed moose, including adults, when the large ungulates are weakened by harsh winter conditions. Killer whales are the moose's only known marine predator as they have been known to prey on moose swimming between islands out of North America's Northwest Coast.In some areas, moose are the primary source of food for wolves. Moose usually flee upon detecting wolves. Wolves usually follow moose at a distance of 100 to, occasionally at a distance of 2 to. Attacks from wolves against young moose may last seconds, though sometimes they can be drawn out for days with adults. Sometimes, wolves will chase moose into shallow streams or onto frozen rivers, where their mobility is greatly impeded. Moose will sometimes stand their ground and defend themselves by charging at the wolves or lashing out at them with their powerful hooves. Wolves typically kill moose by tearing at their haunches and perineum, causing massive blood loss. Occasionally, a wolf may immobilise a moose by biting its sensitive nose, the pain of which can paralyze a moose. Wolf packs primarily target calves and elderly animals, but can and will take healthy, adult moose. Moose between the ages of two and eight are seldom killed by wolves. Though moose are usually hunted by packs, there are cases in which single wolves have successfully killed healthy, fully-grown moose.Carnivores of the World by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), ISBN 9780691152288Research into moose predation suggests that their response to perceived threats is learned rather than instinctual. In practical terms this means moose are more vulnerable in areas where wolf or bear populations were decimated in the past but are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adapt, fleeing an area if they hear or smell wolves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravens.Berger, Joel; Swenson, Jon E.; Persson,Inga-Lill Recolonizing Carnivores and Naive Prey: Conservation Lessons from Pleistocene Extinctions.

Populations expanded greatly with improved habitat and protection, but for unknown reasons, the moose population is declining rapidly. In North America, the moose range includes almost all of Canada (excluding the arctic and Vancouver Island), most of Alaska, northern New England and upstate New York, the upper Rocky Mountains, northern Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and Isle Royale in Lake Superior. This massive range, containing diverse habitats, contains four of the six North American subspecies. In the West, moose populations extend well north into Canada (British Columbia and Alberta), and more isolated groups have been verified as far south as the mountains of Utah and Colorado and as far west as the Lake Wenatchee area of the Washington Cascades. The range includes Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and smaller areas of Washington and Oregon. In 1978, a few breeding pairs were reintroduced in western Colorado, and the state's moose population is now more than 1,000.In northeastern North America, the Eastern moose's history is very well documented: moose meat was often a staple in the diet of Native Americans going back centuries, and it is a tribe that occupied present day coastal Rhode Island that gave this deer its distinctive name in American English. The Native Americans often used moose hides for leather and its meat as an ingredient in pemmican, a type of dried jerky used as a source of sustenance in winter or on long journeys. Eastern tribes also valued moose leather as a source for moccasins and other decorations.The historical range of the subspecies extended from well into Quebec, the Maritimes, and Eastern Ontario south to include all of New England finally ending in the very northeastern tip of Pennsylvania in the west, cutting off somewhere near the mouth of the Hudson River in the east. The moose has been extinct in much of the eastern U.S. for as long as 150 years, due to colonial era overhunting and destruction of its habitat: Dutch, French, and British colonial sources all attest to its presence in the mid 17th century from Maine south to areas within a hundred miles of present day Manhattan. However, by the 1870s, only a handful of moose existed in this entire region in very remote pockets of forest; less than 20% of suitable habitat remained.Since the 1980s, however, moose populations have rebounded, thanks to regrowth of plentiful food sources, abandonment of farmland, better land management, cleanup of pollution, and natural dispersal from the Canadian Maritimes and Quebec. South of the Canadian border Maine has most of the population with a 2012 headcount of about 76,000 moose. Dispersals from Maine over the years have resulted in healthy, growing populations each in Vermont and New Hampshire, notably near bodies of water and as high up as 3,000 feet above sea level in the mountains. In turn dispersals from northern New England have resulted in a growing population of roughly 1,000 plus moose in Massachusetts, where it has been absent since the early 18th century.

For unknown reasons, the moose population is declining rapidly in the Midwest.Moose were successfully introduced on Newfoundland in 1878 and 1904,Moose, Newfoundland Costal Safari where they are now the dominant ungulate, and somewhat less successfully on Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Decline in populationSince the 1990s, moose populations have declined dramatically in virtually every part of North America. The exact cause of the die off is not determined, but appears to be a combination of factors, from change in habitat and heat stress caused by global warming, liver flukes, brain worms, unregulated hunting, the reintroduction of wolves, and winter tick infestations. Europe and AsiaIn Europe, moose are currently found in large numbers throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, and the Baltic States, with more modest numbers in the southern Czech Republic, Belarus and northern Ukraine. They are also widespread through Russia on up through the borders with Finland south towards the border with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching far away eastwards to the Yenisei River in Siberia. The European moose was native to most temperate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland from the end of the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of temperate boreal and deciduous forest. Up through Classical times, the species was certainly thriving in both Gaul and Magna Germania, as it appears in military and hunting accounts of the age. However, as the Roman era faded into medieval times, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after the reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared from France, where its range extended from Normandy in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Farther west, it survived in Alsace and the Netherlands until the 9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were cleared away for feudal lands in the former. It was gone from Switzerland by the year 1000, gone from the western Czech Republic by 1300, gone from Mecklenburg in Germany by c. 1600, and has been gone from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19th century, respectively.By the early 20th century, the very last strongholds of the European moose appeared to be in Scandinavian countries and patchy tracts of Russia, with a few migrants found in what is now Estonia and Lithuania. The USSR and Poland managed to restore portions of the range within its borders (such as the 1951 reintroduction into Kampinos National Park and the later 1958 reintroduction in Belarus), but political complications obviously limited the ability to reintroduce it to other portions of its range. Attempts in 1930 and again in 1967 in marshland north of Berlin were unsuccessful. At present in Poland, populations are recorded in the Biebrza river valley, Kampinos, and in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest. It has migrated into other parts of Eastern Europe and has been spotted in eastern and southern Germany. Unsuccessful thus far in recolonizing these areas via natural dispersal from source populations in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia, it appears to be having more success migrating south into the Caucasus.

Moose populations are relatively stable in Siberia and increasing on the Kamchatka peninsula. In Mongolia and China, where poaching took a great toll on moose, forcing them to near extinction, they are protected, but enforcement of the policy is weak and demand for traditional medicines derived from deer parts is high. In 1978, the Regional Hunting Department transported 45 young moose to the center of Kamchatka. These moose were brought from Chukotka, home to the largest moose on the planet. Kamchatka now regularly is responsible for the largest trophy moose shot around the world each season. As it is a fertile environment for moose, with a milder climate, less snow, and an abundance of food, moose quickly bred and settled along the valley of the Kamchatka River and many surrounding regions. The population in the past 20 years has risen to over 2900 animals.The size of the moose varies. Following Bergmann's rule, population in the south (A. a. cameloides) usually grow smaller, while moose in the north and northeast (A. a. burulini) can match the imposing sizes of the Alaskan moose (A. a. gigas) and are prized by trophy hunters. New ZealandIn 1900, an attempt to introduce moose into the Hokitika area failed; then in 1910 ten moose, four bulls and six cows, were introduced into Fiordland. This area is considered a less than suitable habitat, and subsequent low numbers of sightings and kills have led to some presumption of this population's failure. The last proven sighting of a moose in New Zealand was in 1952. However, a moose antler was found in 1972 and DNA tests showed that hair collected in 2002 was from a moose. There has been extensive searching, and while automated cameras failed to capture photographs, evidence was seen of bedding spots, browsing and antler marks."}, {"description": "The word \"moose\" first entered English by 1606 and is borrowed from the Algonquian languages (compare the Narragansett moos and Eastern Abenaki mos; according to early sources, these were likely derived from moosu, meaning \"he strips off\"), and possibly involved forms from multiple languages mutually reinforcing one another. The Proto-Algonquian form was *mo\u00b7swa. A mature male moose is referred to as a bull; a mature female moose is a cow; and an immature moose of either sex is a calf. The term \"moose\" is a name of North American origin, and the scientific name Alces alces comes from its Latin name. The animal was known in Britain as the \"elk.\" The moose went extinct in Britain during the Bronze age, long before the Europeans' discovery of America. The youngest bones were found in Scotland and are roughly 3900 years old.Feral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea, and Human Life By George Monbiot -- University of Chicago press 2014 Page 124 The word \"elk\" remained in usage because of its existence in continental Europe but, without any animals locally to reference the word to, the meaning became rather vague to most ancient speakers of English, referring to \"large deer\" in general.Mallory, JP and DQ Adams (2006). The Oxford introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European world Oxford University Press. Page 133 Dictionaries of the 18th century simply described \"elk\" as a deer that was \"as large as a horse.\"Bailey, Nathan (1731). An Universal Etymological English Dictionary Royal Exchange. Page EL--EM.Confusingly, the word \"elk\" is used in North America to refer to a different animal, Cervus canadensis, which is also called by the Algonkian indigenous name, \"wapiti\". The British began colonizing America in the 17th century, and found two common species of deer for which they had no names. The wapiti appeared very similar to the red deer of Europe (which itself was almost extinct in Southern Britain) although it was a lot larger and was not red. The moose was a rather strange looking deer to the colonists, and they often adopted local names for both. In the early days of American colonization, the wapiti was often called a grey moose and the moose was often called a black moose, but early accounts of the animals varied wildly, adding to the confusion.Royal Society (Great Britain) (1736). Philosophical Transactions and Collections, Volume 9. p.84.The wapiti is very similar to the red deer of central and western Europe, although it is distinctly different behaviorally and genetically. Early European explorers in North America, particularly in Virginia where there were no moose, called the wapiti \"elk\" because of its size and resemblance to familiar-looking deer like the red deer.The Book of Animal Ignorance: Everything You Think You Know Is Wrong By John Mitchinson, John Lloyd -- Harmony Books 2007 Page 141 The moose resembled the \"German elk\" (the moose of continental Europe), which was less familiar to the British colonists. For a long time neither species had an official name, but were called a variety of things. Eventually, in North America the wapiti became known as an elk while the moose retained its Anglicized Native-American name. In 1736, Samuel Dale wrote to the Royal Society of Great Britain:The common light-grey moose, called by the Indians, Wampoose, and the large or black-moose, which is the beast whose horns I herewith present. As to the grey moose, I take it to be no larger than what Mr. John Clayton, in his account of the Virginia Quadrupeds, calls the Elke ... was in all respects like those of our red-deer or stags, only larger... The black moose is (by all that have hitherto writ of it) accounted a very large creature.... The stag, buck, or male of this kind has a palmed horn, not like that of our common or fallow-deer, but the palm is much longer, and more like that of the German elke.Philosophical Transactions and Collections Volume 9 By Royal Society (Great Britain) 1736 Page 85 In summary, this large animal, Alces alces, is always called a \"moose\" in American English but sometimes called an \"elk\" in British English. That same word \"elk,\" as used by a North American, means a completely different and only somewhat related animal, Cervus canadensis or wapiti.The word \"elk\" originated from Proto-Germanic languages, from which Old English evolved. The British English word \"elk\" has cognates in other Indo-European languages, for example elg in DanishNorwegian; \u00e4lg in Swedish; Elch in German; and \u0142o\u015b in Polish (Latin alc\u0113 or alc\u0113s and Greek \u1f05\u03bb\u03ba\u03b7 \u00e1lk\u0113 are probably Germanic loanwords). In the continental-European languages, these forms of the word \"elk\" almost always refer to the animal called moose."}, {"description": "Diet The moose is a herbivore and is capable of consuming many types of plant or fruit. The average adult moose needs to consume 9770 kcal per day to maintain its body weight. Much of a moose's energy is derived from terrestrial vegetation, mainly consisting of forbs and other non-grasses, and fresh shoots from trees such as willow and birch. These plants are rather low in sodium, and moose generally need to consume a good quantity of aquatic plants. While much lower in energy, these plants provide the moose with its sodium requirements, and as much as half of their diet usually consists of aquatic plant life.Biology by numbers: an encouragement to quantitative thinking By Richard F. Burton \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1998 Page 84-85 In winter, moose are often drawn to roadways, to lick salt that is used as a snow and ice melter.Journey to New England By Patricia Harris, David Lyon \u2013 Patricia Harris-David Lyon 1999 Page 398 A typical moose, weighing 360 kg, can eat up to 32 kg of food per day.Moose lack upper front teeth, but have eight sharp incisors on the lower jaw. They also have a tough tongue, lips and gums, which aid in the eating of woody vegetation. Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead of those, six pairs of premolars, to grind up their food. A moose's upper lip is very sensitive, to help distinguish between fresh shoots and harder twigs, and the lip is prehensile, for grasping their food. In the summer, moose may use this prehensile lip for grabbing branches and pulling, stripping the entire branch of leaves in a single mouthful, or for pulling forbs, like dandelions, or aquatic plants up by the base, roots and all.Seasons of the Moose By Jennie Promack, Thomas J. Sanker -- Gibbs Smith 1992 Page 21A moose's diet often depends on its location, but they seem to prefer the new growths from deciduous trees such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. Many aquatic plants include lilies and pondweed.Moose diet. Mooseworld. Retrieved on 2011-01-09. Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants. In non polar regions this trait serves a second purpose in cooling down the moose on summer days and ridding itself of black flies. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to wet themselves in. Moose have been known to dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater.Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology By Valerius Geist -- Stackpole Books 1998 Page 237 As an adaptation for feeding on plants underwater, the nose is equipped with fatty pads and muscles that close the nostrils when exposed to water pressure, preventing water from entering the nose. AntlersBull moose have antlers like other members of the deer family. Cows select mates based on antler size. Bull moose use dominant displays of antlers to discourage competition and will spar or fight rivals. The size and growth rate of antlers is determined by diet and age; symmetry reflects health.The male's antlers grow as cylindrical beams projecting on each side of the head at right angles to the midline of the skull, and then fork. The lower prong of this fork may be either simple, or divided into two or three tines, with some flattening. Moose antlers are broad and palmate (flat) with tines (points) along the outer edge. The antlers of mature Alaskan adult bull moose (5 to 12 years old) have a normal maximum spread greater than 200 cm. By the age of 13, moose antlers decline in size and symmetry. The widest spread recorded was 210 cm across. (An Alaskan moose also holds the record for the heaviest weight at 36 kg).Antler beam diameter, not the number of tines, indicates age. In North America moose (A. a. americanus) antlers are usually larger than those of Eurasian moose and have two lobes on each side, like a butterfly. Eurasian moose antlers resemble a seashell, with a single lobe on each side. In the North Siberian moose (A. a. bedfordiae), the posterior division of the main fork divides into three tines, with no distinct flattening. In the common moose (A. a. alces) this branch usually expands into a broad palmation, with one large tine at the base and a number of smaller snags on the free border. There is, however, a Scandinavian breed of the common moose in which the antlers are simpler and recall those of the East Siberian animals. The palmation appears to be more marked in North American moose than in the typical Scandinavian moose. After the mating season males drop their antlers to conserve energy for the winter. A new set of antlers will then regrow in the spring. Antlers take three to five months to fully develop, making them one of the fastest growing animal organs. Antler growth is \"nourished by an extensive system of blood vessels in the skin covering, which contains numerous hair follicles that give it a 'velvet' texture.\" This requires intense grazing on a highly-nutritious diet. By September the velvet is removed by rubbing and thrashing which changes the colour of the antlers. Immature bulls may not shed their antlers for the winter, but retain them until the following spring. Birds, carnivores and rodents eat dropped antlers as they are full of protein and moose themselves will eat antler velvet for the nutrients.If a bull moose is castrated, either by accidental or chemical means, he will quickly shed his current set of antlers and then immediately begin to grow a new set of misshapen and deformed antlers that he will wear the rest of his life without ever shedding again. The distinctive looking appendages (often referred to as \"devil's antlers\") are the source of several myths and legends among many groups of Inuit as well as several other tribes of indigenous peoples of North America.Geist, Valerius (1998) Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology Stackpole Books.In extremely rare circumstances, a cow moose may grow antlers. This is usually attributed to a hormone imbalance.It\u2019s a Bull Moose\u2026No a Cow\u2026 Joe Viechnicki, KFSK \u2013 Petersburg 10-19-09 Size and weightOn average, an adult moose stands 1.4 \u2013 high at the shoulder, which is more than a foot higher than the next largest deer on average, the Elk. Males (or \"bulls\") normally weigh from 380 to and females (or \"cows\") typically weigh 200 to, depending on racial or clinal as well as individual age or nutritional variations.Franzmann, A. W. (1981). Alces alces. Mammalian Species, 1-7. The head-and-body length is 2.4 -, with the vestigial tail adding only a further 5 -.Nowak, Ronald W., Walker's Mammals of the World. The Johns Hopkins University Press (1999), ISBN 978-0-8018-5789-8 The largest of all the races is the Alaskan subspecies (A. a. gigas), which can stand over 2.1\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) at the shoulder, has a span across the antlers of 1.8\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft) and averages 634.5\u00a0kg (1,396\u00a0lbs) in males and 478\u00a0kg (1,052\u00a0lbs) in females. Typically, however, the antlers of a mature bull are between 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) and 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft). The largest confirmed size for this species was a bull shot at the Yukon River in September 1897 that weighed 820\u00a0kg (1,800\u00a0lb) and measured 2.33 m high at the shoulder.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc (1983), ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9 There have been reported cases of even larger moose, including a bull that reportedly scaled 1180 kg, but none are authenticated and some may not be considered reliable. Behind only the two species of bison, the moose is the second largest land animal in both North America and Europe. Social structure and reproductionMoose are mostly diurnal. They are generally solitary with the strongest bonds between mother and calf. Although moose rarely gather in groups, there may be several in close proximity during the mating season.Mating occurs in September and October. The males are polygamous and will seek several females to breed with. During this time both sexes will call to each other. Males produce heavy grunting sounds that can be heard from up to 500 meters away, while females produce wail-like sounds. Males will fight for access to females. They either assess which is larger, with the smaller bull retreating, or they may engage in battles, usually only involving the antlers.Female moose have an eight-month gestation period, usually bearing one calf, or twins if food is plentiful, in May or June. Newborn moose have fur with a reddish hue in contrast to the brown appearance of an adult. The young will stay with the mother until just before the next young are born. The life span of an average moose is about 15\u201325 years. AggressionMoose are not usually aggressive towards humans, but can be provoked or frightened to behave with aggression. In terms of raw numbers, they attack more people than bears and wolves combined, but usually with only minor consequences. In the Americas, moose injure more people than any other wild mammal and, worldwide, only hippopotamuses injure more.Adventure Guide Inside Passage & Coastal Alaska By Ed Readicker-Henderson, Lynn Readicker-Henderson -- Hunter Publishing 2006 Page 49 When harassed or startled by people or in the presence of a dog, moose may charge. Also, as with bears or any wild animal, moose that have become habituated to being fed by people may act aggressively when denied food. During the fall mating season, bull moose may be aggressive toward humans due to the high hormone levels they experience. Cows with young calves are very protective and will attack humans who come too close, especially if they come between mother and calf. Unlike other dangerous animals, moose are not territorial, and do not view humans as food, and will therefore usually not pursue humans if they simply run away. Like any wild animal, moose are unpredictable and should be given a respectful amount of space. They are most likely to attack if annoyed or harassed, or if their \"personal space\" has been encroached upon. A moose that has been harassed may vent its anger on anyone in the vicinity, and they often do not make distinctions between their tormentors and innocent passers-by. Moose are very limber animals with highly flexible joints and sharp, pointed hooves, and are capable of kicking with both front and back legs. Unlike other large, hooved mammals, such as horses, moose can kick in all directions including sideways. Therefore, there is no safe side from which to approach. However, moose often give warning signs prior to attacking, displaying their aggression by means of body language. The maintaining of eye contact is usually the first sign of aggression, while laid-back ears or a lowered head is a definite sign of agitation. If the hairs on the back of the moose's neck and shoulders (hackles) stand up, a charge is usually imminent. The Anchorage Visitor Centers warn tourists that \"...a moose with its hackles raised is a thing to fear.\"Adventure Guide Alaska Highway By Ed Readicker-Henderson, Lynn Readicker-Henderson -- Hunter Publishing 2006 Page 416Explorer's Guide 50 Hikes Around Anchorage By Lisa Maloney -- The Countryman Press 2010 Page 16Field & Stream Aug 2002 -- Page 75--77Wilderness Camping & Hiking By Paul Tawrell -- Exxa Nature 2007 Page 161Studies suggest that the calls made by female moose during the rut not only call the males but can actually induce a bull to invade another bull's harem and fight for control of it. This in turn means that the cow moose has at least a small degree of control over which bulls she mates with.US Fed News Service, Female moose moans provoke bull fights, females have more choice in picking mates, concludes Idaho state university study 8/3/2011Moose often show aggression to other animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose have been reported to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known to stomp attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often more aggressive than North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated at the sight of a predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color."}, {"description": "The moose (North America) or Eurasian elk (Europe), Alces alces, is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the palmate antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic (\"twig-like\") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal and mixed deciduous forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Moose used to have a much wider range but hunting and other human activities greatly reduced it over the years. Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are wolves, bears, and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move surprisingly quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn can lead to spectacular fights between males competing for a female."}]}

The fruit bat is considered a whisper bat and makes 3 low-intensity FM pulses during flight and when resting.Breeding in the Jamaican fruit bat that is bimodal and polyestrous with births being dependent on fruit abundance. Females give birth twice a year with one young on average for each birth. Mating is highest at the end of the wet season and births take place in the dry months. Embryonic development may delay in the second breeding season but parturition will occur in the follow breeding period.Fleming T. H. 1971.

Gestation is usually 3.5\u20134 months but can be as long as 7 months when there's delayed embryonic development. The female gives birth while perching and the newborn emerges unaided, head first. The mothers will eat the placenta. Mothers carry their pups when they are one day old but later leave them in the roosting area for the day.

The bulls haul out on isolated or otherwise protected beaches, typically on islands or very remote mainland locations. It is important that these beach areas offer protection from the winter storms and high surf wave action. The bulls engage in fights of supremacy to determine which few bulls will achieve a harem.After the males have arrived the beach, the females arrive to give birth. Females fast for five weeks and nurse their single pup for four weeks; in the last few days of lactation, females come into estrus and mate. In this polygynous society, a high-ranking bull can have a harem of 30\u2013100 cows, depending on his size and strength. Males unable to establish harems will wait on the periphery, and will try to mount nearby females. Dominant bulls will disrupt copulations of lower-ranking bulls. They can mount females without interference, but commonly break off to chase off rivals. While fights are not usually to the death, they are brutal and often with significant bloodshed and injury; however, in many cases of mismatched opponents, the younger, less capable males are simply chased away, often to upland dunes. In a lifetime, a successful bull could easily sire over 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls. After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression is more common in crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own. An orphaned pup may try to find another female to suckle and some are adopted, at least on A\u00f1o Nuevo Island. Pups nurse about four weeks and are weaned abruptly approximately two months before being abandoned by their mother. Left alone, weaned pups will gather into groups and stay on shore for 12 more weeks. The pups learn how to swim in the surf and eventually swim farther to forage. Thus, their first long journey at sea begins.Elephant seals communicate though various means. Males will threaten each other with the snort, a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable to the sound of a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy in crowded or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting."}, {"description": "The northern elephant seal lives in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Feeding grounds extend from northern Baja California to northern Vancouver Island. Males migrate as far north as Alaska and British Columbia, while females migrate as far west as Hawaii. They come ashore to breed, give birth and molt, mostly on offshore islands. While the pelagic range covers an enormous span, breeding is restricted to only about seven principal areas, four of which are on islands off the coast of California. Recently, increasing numbers have been observed in the Gulf of California.

Some individuals have been observed on the coast of northeast Asia. Certain individuals established haul-out sites at the Commander Islands in the early 2000s; however, due to aggressive interactions with local Steller sea lions, long-term colonization is not expected. The northern elephant seals are nocturnal deep feeders famous for the long time intervals they remain underwater. This species dives to great depths while feeding, typically between 300 m and 800 m; moreover, the northern elephant seal will generally not feed in depths of less than 200 m. Both sexes eat a variety of prey, including pelagic, deep-water squid, Pacific hake, sharks, rays, and ratfish. Octopoteuthis deletron squid are the most common prey item, found in the stomachs of 58% of individuals sampled off the coast of California. A female northern elephant seal was documented in 2013 by a deep sea camera at a depth of 894 m, where it consumed a Pacific hagfish, slurping it up from the ocean floor. The event was reported by a Ukrainian boy named Kirill Dudko, who further reported the find to scientists in Canada.Outdoor. GrindTV. Retrieved on 2014-03-18. Elephant seals do not need to drink, as they get their water from food and metabolism of fats.While hunting in the dark depths, elephant seals seem to locate their prey at least partly by vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals do not have a developed a system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae, which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed to play a role in search of food. Males and females differ in diving behavior. Males tend to hug the continental shelf while making deep dives and forage along the bottom, while females have more jagged routes and forage in the open ocean. Males return to the same feeding ground every year, while females have less predictable feeding migrations. Elephant seals are prey for killer whales and white sharks. Both are most likely to hunt pups, and seldom hunt large bull elephant seals, but have taken seals of all ages. The shark, when hunting adults, is most likely to ambush a seal with a damaging bite and wait until it is weakened by blood loss to finish the kill.White Sharks \u2013 Carcharodon carcharias. Pelagic Shark Research Foundation."}, {"description": "Beginning in the 18th century, northern elephant seals were hunted extensively, almost to extinction by the end of the 19th century, being prized for oil made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as 20. In 1874, Charles Melville Scammon recorded in Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of America, that an 18-ft-long bull caught on Santa Barbara Island yielded 210 gallons of oil. They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of the eight for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Since the early 20th century, they have been protected by law in both Mexico and in the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 100,000.Nevertheless, a genetic bottleneck exists in the existing population, which could make it more susceptible to disease and pollution. In California, the population is continuing to grow at around 25% per year, and new colonies are being established; they are now probably limited mostly by the availability of haul-out space. Their breeding was probably restricted to islands, before large carnivores were exterminated or prevented from reaching the side of the ocean. Numbers can be adversely affected by El Ni\u00f1o events and the resultant weather conditions, and the 1997\u201398 El Ni\u00f1o may have caused the loss of about 80% of that year's pups. Presently, the northern elephant seal is protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and has a fully protected status under California law.Populations of rookery sites in California have increased during the past century. At A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park, for example, no individuals were observed whatsoever until the 1950s; the first pup born there was observed in the early 1960s. Currently, thousands of pups are born every year at A\u00f1o Nuevo, on both the island and mainland. The growth of the site near San Simeon has proved even more spectacular; no animals were there prior to 1990. Currently, the San Simeon site hosts more breeding animals than A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park during winter season."}, {"description": "The huge male northern elephant seal typically weighs 1,500\u20132,300\u00a0kg (3,300\u20135,100\u00a0lbs) and measures 4\u20135 m (13.2\u201316.5\u00a0ft), although some males can weigh up to 3,700\u00a0kg (8,152\u00a0lbs).Beer, Encyclopedia of North American Mammals: An Essential Guide to Mammals of North America.

M. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. ISBN 0-8018-5789-9 Both adult and juvenile elephant seals are bar-skinned and black before molting. After molting, they generally have a silver to dark gray coat that fades to brownish-yellow and tan. Adult males have hairless necks and chests speckled with pink, white and light brown. Pups are mostly black at birth and molt to a silver gray after weaning.The eyes are large, round and black. The width of the eyes and a high concentration of low light pigments suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have atrophied hind limbs whose underdeveloped ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the \"feet\" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile, dual palm is used to propel water. The pectoral fins are used little while swimming. While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8\u00a0km/h) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, catch up with a female or chase an intruder.Like other seals, elephant seals' bloodstreams are adapted to the cold in which a mixture of small veins surrounds arteries capturing heat from them. This structure is present in extremities such as the hind legs.A unique characteristic of the northern elephant seal is that it has developed the ability to store oxygenated red blood cells within its spleen. In a 2004 study researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleen of 5 seal pups during simulated dives. By 3 minutes, the spleens on average contracted to a fifth of their original size, indicating a dive-related sympathetic contraction of the spleen. Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased hematocrit within the circulating blood, and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This fluid-filled structure is initially expanded due to the rush of RBC from the spleen and slowly releases the red blood cells into the circulatory system via a muscular vena caval sphincter found on the cranial aspect of the diaphragm. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit."}, {"description": "The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) is one of two species of elephant seal (the other is the southern elephant seal).

Sexual dimorphism in size is great: The males can grow to 14 ft and 5000 lb, while the females grow to 11 ft and 1400 lb. Correspondingly, the mating system is highly polygynous; a successful male is able to impregnate up to 50 females in one season."}]}

Males may breed with more than one female. Mating occurs in late summer and early fall. American badgers experience delayed implantation. Pregnancies are suspended until December or as late as February. Young are born from late March to early April. Litters range from one to five young, averaging about three.Badgers are born blind, furred, and helpless. Eyes open at four to six weeks. The female feeds her young solid foods prior to complete weaning, and for a few weeks thereafter. Young American badgers first emerge from the den on their own at five to six weeks old. Families usually break up and juveniles disperse from the end of June to August; young American badgers leave their mothers as early as late May or June. Juvenile dispersal movements are erratic. Most female American badgers become pregnant for the first time after they are a year old. A minority of females four to five months old ovulate and a few become pregnant. Males usually do not breed until their second year.Major causes of adult American badger mortality include, first and foremost, loss of habitat and habitat fragmentation, preventing the ability to move through a normal range, and then automobiles, ranchers and farmers (by various methods), sport shooting, and fur trapping. Identifying habitat areas preferred by adult female badgers for breeding, birthing and raising young are critically important to support biodiversity in the context of climate change impacts, loss of habitat and competition among species for habitat areas as coastal wildlife migrate inland, seeking cooler temperatures in upland habitat areas that often represent established habitat for American Badger. Large predators occasionally kill American badgers. The average longevity in the wild is 9\u201310 years and the record is 14 years;Lindsey, Frederick G. 1971.

They are sometimes found at elevations up to 12,000 feet (3,600 m) but are usually found in the Sonoran and Transition life zones (which are at elevations lower and warmer than those characterized by coniferous forests). In Arizona, they occur in desert scrub and semidesert grasslands.Davis, Russell; Sidner, Ronnie. 1992.

Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona, School of Renewable Natural Resources, Cooperative National Park esources Study Unit In California, American badgers are primarily able to survive through a combination of open grasslands of agricultural lands, protected land trust and open space lands, and even regional and state and national park lands with grassland habitat. An identified population in South Sonoma County fragilely survives with areas of abundant prey, but threatened from fragmentation. The Sonoma County badger population also includes some protected and private lands near the Sonoma Coast. Badgers are occasionally found in open chaparral (with less than 50% plant cover) and riparian zones. They are not usually found in mature chaparral.Quinn, Ronald D. 1990. Habitat preferences and distribution of mammals in California chaparral. Res. Pap. PSW-202. Berkeley, CA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station In Manitoba aspen parklands, American badger abundance was positively associated with the abundance of Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii). American badger use of home range varies with season and sex. Different areas of the home range are used more frequently at different seasons and usually are related to prey availability. Males generally have larger home ranges than females. In a study almost 40 years ago, radiotransmitter-tagged American badgers had an average annual home range of 2,100 acres (850 ha). The home range of one female was 1,790 acres (725 ha) in summer, 131 acres (53 ha) in fall, and 5 acres (2 ha) in winter. Lindzey reported average home ranges of 667 to 1,550 acres (270\u2013627 ha). In 2014, severe fragmentation of American Badger habitat from over-development of land and blockage of wildlife movement areas equate to the range of a badger being significantly influenced by available land for habitat and foraging as well as the ability to move within a preferred range. Direct observations in Sonoma County, documenting habitat and badger sightings and foraging, reflect various ranges within the fragmented habitat areas from less than 1/2 mile to approximately 4 miles. Within these areas, the availability of prey and a fresh water source are key factors for the preferred habitat areas and ability to survive. Identifying and conserving habitat areas where there is year-round activity, along with identified burrowing patterns and observations of female badger territory for birthing and raising young have become critical factors in survival of the species.Estimated density of American badgers in Utah scrub-steppe was one per square mile (2.6\u00a0km2), or 10 dens per square mile (assuming a single American badger has 10 dens in current or recent use).The American badger in Ontario, is restricted primarily to the extreme southwestern portion of the province \u2013 largely along the north shore of Lake Erie in open areas generally associated with agriculture and woodland edges. There have been a few reports from the Bruce-Grey region. Plant communitiesAmerican badgers are most commonly found in treeless areas, including tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, grass-dominated meadows and fields within forested habitats, and shrub-steppe communities. In the Southwest, plant indicators of the Sonoran and Transition life zones (relatively low, dry elevations) commonly associated with American badgers include creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), junipers (Juniperus spp.), gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), willows (Salix spp.), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grasses, and sagebrushes (Artemisia spp.).In Colorado 37 years ago, American badgers were common in grass\u2013forb and ponderosa pine habitats.Morris, Meredith J.; Reid, Vincent H.; Pillmore, Richard E.; Hammer, Mary C. 1977. Birds and mammals of Manitou Experimental Forest, Colorado. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-38. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment. In Kansas, they are common in tallgrass prairie dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans). In Montana 24 years ago, badgers were present in Glacier National Park in fescue (Festuca spp.) grasslands.Tyser, Robin W. 1990. Ecology of fescue grasslands in Glacier National Park. In: Boyce, Mark S.; Plumb, Glenn E., eds. National Park Service Research Center, 14th annual report. Laramie, WY: University of Wyoming, National Park Service Research Center: 59\u201360 In Manitoba, they occur in grassland extensions within aspen (Populus spp.) parklands. Cover requirementsAmerican badgers enlarge foraged out gopher holes or other prey holes or burrows to create a burrow for sleeping and concealment, protection from weather, and natal dens; burrows range from about 4 feet to 10 feet in depth and 4 feet to 6 feet in width. A female American Badger may create 2 to 4 burrows in proximity with a connecting tunnel for concealment and safety for her young. Displaced soil from digging out the burrow characteristically appears in front of the burrow entrance, and a view from a distance reveals a mound-like roof of the burrow, with the living and concealment space created underneath the raised-roof appearing mound. During summer and autumn, badgers range more frequently, with mating season generally in November, and burrowing patterns reflect 1 to 3 burrows may be dug from foraged out prey holes in a day, used for a day to a week, and then abandoned, with possible returns later, and other small wildlife utilizing abandoned burrows in the interim. Where prey is particularly plentiful, they will reuse dens,Long, Charles A.; Killingley, Carl Arthur. 1983. The badgers of the world. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishing especially in the fall, sometimes for a few days at a time. In winter, a single den may be used for most of the season. Natal dens are dug by the female and are used for extended periods, but litters may be moved, probably to allow the mother to forage in new areas close to the nursery. Natal dens are usually larger and more complex than diurnal dens."}, {"description": "The American badger is a fossorial carnivore.

Northern subspecies such as T. t. jeffersonii are heavier than the southern subspecies. In the fall, when food is plentiful, adult male badgers can exceed 11.5\u00a0kg (25.3 pounds).

The coat aids in camouflage in grassland habitat. Its triangular face shows a distinctive black and white pattern, with brown or blackish \"badges\" marking the cheeks and a white stripe extending from the nose to the base of the head. In the subspecies T. t. berlandieri, the white head stripe extends the full length of the body, to the base of the tail."}, {"description": "In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed both the Taxidea taxus jacksoni and the T. t. jeffersonii subspecies as an endangered species in Canada. The California Department of Fish and Game designated the American badger as a California species of special concern."}, {"description": "American badgers are generally nocturnal, but have been reported to be active during the day. In remote areas with no human encroachment, badgers are routinely observed foraging during the day. Seasonally, however, a badger observed during daylight hours in the Spring months of late March to early May often represents a female badger, foraging during daylight to then return and stay with her young at night. Badgers do not hibernate, but may become less active in winter. A badger may spend much of the winter in cycles of torpor that last around 29 hours. They do emerge from their burrows when the temperature is above freezing. Badger burrows that are abandoned may then be occupied by foxes, skunks or animals of similar size. Abandoned badger burrows also provide ready-made homes for burrowing owl, California Tiger Salamander and California Red-Legged Frog. A misconception about badgers and coyotes is reflected in the human projected perception that badgers and coyotes form a mutually beneficial relationship in hunting and foraging. In fact, the benefit is for the coyote. Coyotes are not as effective in digging prey out of burrows and will remain in proximity to a foraging badger, to then capture prey if it escapes the badger's claw-paws. Widely reported has been the misconception that badgers and coyotes hunt together. Badgers are solitary foragers and coyotes who observe badgers in the process of seeking prey will position themselves in proximity in order to attempt to capture any prey that eludes a badger in its attempt to escape."}, {"description": "The American badger (Taxidea taxus) is a North American badger, somewhat similar in appearance to the European badger. It is found in the western and central United States, northern Mexico, and south-central Canada to certain areas of southwestern British Columbia.American badger habitat is typefied by open grasslands with available prey (such as mice, squirrels, and groundhogs). The species prefers areas such as prairie regions with sandy loam soils where it can dig more easily for its prey."}]}

It is one of five species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from southeast Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic, males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by killer whales and white sharks.California sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories and try to attract females to mate with. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside of their breeding season, sea lions spend much of their time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.Sea lions are particularly intelligent and can be trained to perform various tasks. Because of this, California sea lions are commonly found in public displays in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, where they are known as the classic \"seals,\" and are trained by the US Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials."}, {"description": "Being sexually dimorphic, California sea lions differ in size, shape, and coloration between the sexes. Males are typically around 2.4 m long and weigh up to 350 kg, while females are typically around 1.8 m and weigh up to 100 kg. Females and juveniles have a tawny brown pelage, although they may be temporarily light gray or silver after molting. The pelage of adult males can be anywhere from light brown to black, but is typically dark brown. The face of adult males may also be light tan in some areas. Pups have a black or dark brown pelage at birth. Although the species has a slender build, adult males have robust necks, chests, and shoulders. Adult males also have a protruding crest which gives them a \"high, domed forehead\"; it is tufted with white hairs. They also have manes, which are less developed than those of adult male South American and Steller sea lions. Both sexes have long, narrow muzzles.As an otariid, the California sea lion relies on its foreflippers to propel itself when swimming. This form of aquatic locomotion, along with its streamlined body, effectively reduces drag underwater. Its foreflipper movement is not continuous; the animal glides in between each stroke. The flexibility of its spine allows the sea lion to bend its neck backwards far enough to reach its hindflippers. This allows the animal to make dorsal turns and maintain a streamlined posture. When moving on land, the sea lion is able to turn its hindflippers forward and walk on all fours. It moves the foreflippers in a transverse, rather than a sagittal, fashion. In addition, it relies on movements of its head and neck more than its hindflippers for terrestrial locomotion. Sea lions may travel at speeds of around 10.8 km/h, and can dive at depths of 274 m and for up to 9.9 minutes, though most dives are typically 80 m and last less than 3 minutes. Sea lions have color vision, though it is limited to the blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an adaptation for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4\u201332 kHz. Sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well."}, {"description": "Range and habitatThe California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed. During the breeding season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half a mile from the San Joaquin River. Diet and predationCalifornia sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and seamounts. They may also search along the ocean bottom. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. Sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between 10 \u2013 from shore. Males may forage as far as 450 km from shore when water temperatures rise. They also have learned to feed on steelhead and salmon below fish ladders at Bonneville Dam and at other locations where fish must queue in order to pass through dams and locks that block their passage.Sea lions are preyed on by killer whales and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions appear to be the more common food items for transient mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore."}, {"description": "Marine biologist Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied sea lions' cognitive ability. They have discovered that sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. Sea lions have demonstrated the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a California sea lion named \"Ronan\" was recorded bobbing its head in synchronization to musical rhythms. This \"rhythmic entrainment\" was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry. Because of their intelligence and trainability, California sea lions have been used by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. Trainers reward their animals with fish, which motivates them to perform. For ball balancing, trainers toss a ball at a sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining an understanding of what to do. A sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a trick for the public. However, its memory allows it to perform a trick even after three months of resting. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are \"exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors\" and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment.The California sea lion is used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals can swim behind divers approaching a US naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that since operations put the animals in danger. However, the Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete."}, {"description": "Reproductive behavior and parenting California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Most fights occur during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. Since temperatures can reach over 30 C during this time, males must include water within their territories. Some territories are mostly underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. Sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach. Before mating begins, females gather into \"milling\" groups of 2\u201320 individuals. The females in these groups will mount each other as well as the males. These groups begin to disintegrate as the females begin to mate. The territorial and mating system of the California sea lion has been described as similar to a lek system, as females appear to choose their mates while moving though different territories. They avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic. Males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories, particularly in water. Mating may occur outside the rookeries, between non-territorial males and females, as the latter move to and from the mating site. In some rookeries, copulation may be monopolized by a few males, while at others, a single male may sire no more than four pups.Female California sea lions have a 12-month reproductive cycle, consisting of a 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups for up to a day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year. Communication California sea lions communicate with a range of vocalizations. The most commonly used one is their characteristic bark. Territorial males are the loudest and most continuous callers, and barks are produced constantly during the peak of the breeding season. Sea lions bark especially rapidly when excited. The barks of territorial and non-territorial males sound similar, although those of the former are deeper. Males may bark when threatening other males or during courtship. The only other vocalization made by territorial males is a \"prolonged hoarse grunt sound\" made when an individual is startled by a human. This vocalization is also made by groups of non-reproductive males.Female sea lions are less vocal. Their barks, high-pitched and shorter than those made by males, are used in aggressive situations. Other aggressive vocalizations given by females include the \"squeal\", the \"belch\", and the \"growl\". The sound a female sea lion gives when calling her pups is called a \"pup-attraction call\", described as \"loud\" and \"brawling\". Pups respond with a \"mother-response call\", which is similar in structure. Pups will also bleat or bark when playing or in distress. California sea lions can produce vocalizations underwater. These include \"whinny\" sounds, barks, buzzings, and clicks. Nonbreeding activitiesOutside of the breeding season, males migrate to the northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near the breeding rookeries. Sea lions can stay at sea for as long as two weeks at a time. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. Sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. Gulf of California sea lions do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf year-round."}, {"description": "The IUCN lists the California sea lion as Least Concern due to \"its large and increasing population size.\" The estimated population is 238,000\u2013241,000 for the US or Pacific Temperate stock, 75,000\u201385,000 for the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and 31,393 for the population in the Gulf of California. Off the US coast, sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity, while the Gulf of California population declined by 20% by 2008. Sea lions may be killed when in conflict with fishermen, by poaching, and by entanglements in man-made garbage. They are also threatened by pollutants like DDT and PCB which accumulate in the marine food chain. In the United States, the California sea lion is protected on the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal. In 1994 an amendment to the Act allowed for the possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should the level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact on the decline or recovery of ESA-listed salmonids. Applications have been granted for removal of several individual sea lions at Ballard Locks and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period. Critics have objected to the killing of the sea lions, pointing out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.These animals exploit more man-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them."}, {"description": "The California sea lion was described by Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus Zalophus, which derives from the Greek words za, meaning \"intensive,\" and lophus, meaning \"crest.\" This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.Traditionally, the Galapagos sea lion and Japanese sea lion were classified as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon."}, {"description": "Der Kalifornische Seel\u00f6we (Zalophus californianus) ist eine Ohrenrobbe, die an den nordamerikanischen K\u00fcsten des Pazifiks verbreitet ist.Der Kalifornische Seel\u00f6we ist als eigene Art anerkannt.

In most populations, females are 10\u201315% smaller than males, thus making them about the same size as large male stoats. The eyes are black in daylight, but glow bright emerald green when caught in a spotlight at night. The dorsal fur is brown in summer, while the underparts are whitish and tinged with yellowish or buffy brown from the chin to the inguinal region. The tail has a distinct black tip. Long-tailed weasels in Florida and the southwestern US may have facial markings of a white or yellowish colour. In northern areas in winter, the long-tailed weasel's fur becomes white, sometimes with yellow tints, but the tail retains its black tip. The long-tailed weasel moults twice annually, once in autumn (October to mid-November) and once in spring (March\u2013April). Each moult takes about 3\u20134 weeks and is governed by day length and mediated by the pituitary gland. Unlike the stoat, whose soles are thickly furred all year, the long-tailed weasel's soles are naked in summer. The long-tailed weasel has well-developed anal scent glands, which produce a strong and musky odour. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces in order to leave the scent, to mark their territory and, when startled or threatened, to discourage predators.Long-tailed Weasel.

Retrieved on 2014-05-10."}, {"description": "The long-tailed weasel is the product of a process begun 5\u20137 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The long-tailed weasel's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The long-tailed weasel arose in North America 2 million years ago, shortly before the stoat evolved as its mirror image in Eurasia. The species thrived during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. The long-tailed weasel and the stoat remained separated until half a million years ago, when falling sea levels exposed the Bering land bridge, thus allowing the stoat to cross into North America. However, unlike the latter species, the long-tailed weasel never crossed the land bridge, and did not spread into Eurasia."}, {"description": "Reproduction and developmentThe long-tailed weasel mates in July\u2013August, with implantation of the fertilized egg on the uterine wall being delayed until about March. The gestation period lasts 10 months, with actual embryonic development taking place only during the last four weeks of this period, an adaptation to timing births for spring, when small mammals are abundant. Litter size generally consists of 5\u20138 kits, which are born in April\u2013May. The kits are born partially naked, blind and weighing 3\u00a0grams, about the same weight of a hummingbird. The long-tailed weasel's growth rate is rapid, as by the age of three weeks, the kits are well furred, can crawl outside the nest and eat meat. At this time, the kits weigh 21\u201327\u00a0grams. At five weeks of age, the kit's eyes open, and they become physically active and vocal. Weaning begins at this stage, with the kits emerging from the nest and accompanying the mother in hunting trips a week later. The kits are fully grown by autumn and, by this time, the family disbands. The females are able to breed at 3\u20134 months of age, while males become sexually mature at 15\u201318 months. Denning and sheltering behaviourThe long-tailed weasel dens in ground burrows, under stumps or beneath rock piles. It usually does not dig its own burrows, but commonly uses abandoned chipmunk holes. The 22\u201330\u00a0cm (8.66\u201311.8\u00a0in.) diameter nest chamber is situated around 60\u00a0cm (23.6\u00a0in.) from the burrow entrance, and is lined with straw and the fur of prey. Diet The long-tailed weasel is a fearless and aggressive hunter which may attack animals far larger than itself. When stalking, it waves its head from side to side in order to pick up the scent of its prey. It hunts small prey, such as mice, by rushing at them and kills them with one bite to the head. With large prey, such as rabbits, the long-tailed weasel strikes quickly, taking its prey off guard. It grabs the nearest part of the animal and climbs upon its body, maintaining its hold with its feet. The long-tailed weasel then manoeuvres itself to inflict a lethal bite to the neck.The long-tailed weasel is an obligate carnivore which prefers its prey to be fresh or alive, eating only the carrion stored within its burrows. Rodents are almost exclusively taken when they are available. Its primary prey consists of mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, shrews, moles and rabbits. Occasionally, it may eat small birds, bird eggs, reptiles, amphibians, fish, earthworms and some insects. The species has also been observed to take bats from nursery colonies. It occasionally surplus kills, usually in spring when the kits are being fed, and again in autumn. Some of the surplus kills may be cached, but are usually left uneaten. Kits in captivity eat from \u00bc\u2013\u00bd of their body weight in 24 hours, while adults eat only one fifth to one third. After killing its prey, the long-tailed weasel laps up the blood, but does not suck it, as is popularly believed. With small prey, also the fur, feathers, flesh and bones are consumed, but only some flesh is eaten from large prey. When stealing eggs, the long-tailed weasel removes each egg from its nest one at a time, then carries it in its mouth to a safe location where it bites off the top and licks out the contents or if they have babies in the den they may hold it in their mouth all the way back to them."}, {"description": "The long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), also known as the bridled weasel or big stoat is a species of mustelid distributed from southern Canada throughout all the United States and Mexico, southward through all of Central America and into northern South America."}]}

The Ursinae subfamily originated approximately 4.2 million years ago. The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. Fossils show that between ten to twenty thousand years ago, the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear.Kurten 1964 Polar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula).The evidence from DNA analysis is more complex. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear, Ursus arctos, roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear would not be a true species according to some species concepts. The mtDNA of Irish brown bears is particularly close to polar bears. A comparison of the nuclear genome of polar bears with that of brown bears revealed a different pattern, the two forming genetically distinct clades that diverged approximately 603,000 years ago, although the latest research is based on analysis of the complete genomes (rather than just the mitochondria or partial nuclear genomes) of polar, brown and black bears, and establishes the divergence of polar and brown bears at 4\u20135 million years ago.However, the two species have mated intermittently for all that time, most likely coming into contact with each other during warming periods, when polar bears were driven onto land and brown bears migrated northward. Most brown bears have about 2 percent genetic material from polar bears, but one population residing in the Alexander Archipelago has between 5 percent and 10 percent polar bear genes, indicating more frequent and recent mating. Polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrids, rather than indicating that they have only recently diverged, the new evidence suggests more frequent mating has continued over a longer period of time, and thus the two bears remain genetically similar. However, because neither species can survive long in the other's ecological niche, and because they have different morphology, metabolism, social and feeding behaviors, and other phenotypic characteristics, the two bears are generally classified as separate species.When the polar bear was originally documented, two subspecies were identified: Ursus maritimus maritimus by Constantine J. Phipps in 1774, and Ursus maritimus marinus by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. This distinction has since been invalidated. One fossil subspecies has been identified. Ursus maritimus tyrannus\u00a0\u2014 descended from Ursus arctos\u00a0\u2014 became extinct during the Pleistocene. U.m. tyrannus was significantly larger than the living subspecies."}, {"description": "The polar bear is protected by many US laws, most naotably the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act U.S. Marine Mammal Protection ActPolar bears are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibits the take (i.e., harass, hunt, capture, or kill) of all marine mammals. U.S. Endangered Species ActOn 14 May 2008 the U.S. Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, citing the melting of Arctic sea ice as the primary threat to the polar bear. Canadian endangered species legislationIn Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada recommended in April 2008 that the polar bear be assessed as a species of special concern under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A listing would mandate that a management plan be written within five years, a timeline criticized by the World Wide Fund for Nature as being too long to prevent significant habitat loss from climate change."}, {"description": "The polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses as far south as Newfoundland Island. Due to the absence of human development in its remote habitat, it retains more of its original range than any other extant carnivore. While they are rare north of 88\u00b0, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic, and as far south as James Bay in Canada. Their southernmost range is near the boundary between the subarctic and humid continental climate zones. They can occasionally drift widely with the sea ice, and there have been anecdotal sightings as far south as Berlev\u00e5g on the Norwegian mainland and the Kuril Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied; however, biologists use a working estimate of about 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide.There are 19 generally recognized, discrete subpopulations.Aars, pp. 33\u201355. The subpopulations display seasonal fidelity to particular areas, but DNA studies show that they are not reproductively isolated. The thirteen North American subpopulations range from the Beaufort Sea south to Hudson Bay and east to Baffin Bay in western Greenland and account for about 70% of the global population. The Eurasian population is broken up into the eastern Greenland, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and Chukchi Sea subpopulations, though there is considerable uncertainty about the structure of these populations due to limited mark and recapture data. The range includes the territory of five nations: Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), Russia, the United States (Alaska) and Canada. These five nations are the signatories of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, which mandates cooperation on research and conservations efforts throughout the polar bear's range.Modern methods of tracking polar bear populations have been implemented only since the mid-1980s, and are expensive to perform consistently over a large area. The most accurate counts require flying a helicopter in the Arctic climate to find polar bears, shooting a tranquilizer dart at the bear to sedate it, and then tagging the bear. In Nunavut, some Inuit have reported increases in bear sightings around human settlements in recent years, leading to a belief that populations are increasing. Scientists have responded by noting that hungry bears may be congregating around human settlements, leading to the illusion that populations are higher than they actually are. The Polar Bear Specialist Group of the IUCN takes the position that \"estimates of subpopulation size or sustainable harvest levels should not be made solely on the basis of traditional ecological knowledge without supporting scientific studies.\"Aars, pp. 61\u201362Of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations, eight are declining, three are stable, one is increasing, and seven have insufficient data, as of 2009.Polar Bears and Conservation and"}, {"description": "Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774. He chose the scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin for 'maritime bear', due to the animal's native habitat.

In the Norwegian-administered Svalbard archipelago, the polar bear is referred to as Isbj\u00f8rn (\"ice bear\").The polar bear was previously considered to be in its own genus, Thalarctos.This combines the Ancient Greek words thalassa/\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 'sea', and arctos/\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 'bear' and also, with reference to Ursa Major, 'northern' or 'of the north pole' However, evidence of hybrids between polar bears and brown bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does not support the establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps originally proposed."}, {"description": "Indigenous folkloreFor the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, polar bears have long played an important cultural and material role.Lockwood, pp. 6\u20139 Polar bear remains have been found at hunting sites dating to 2,500 to 3,000 years agoLockwood, pp. 31\u201336 and 1,500 year old cave paintings of polar bears have been found in the Chukchi Peninsula. Indeed, it has been suggested that Arctic peoples' skills in seal hunting and igloo construction has been in part acquired from the polar bears themselves.The Inuit and Alaska Natives have many folk tales featuring the bears including legends in which bears are humans when inside their own houses and put on bear hides when going outside, and stories of how the constellation which is said to resemble a great bear surrounded by dogs came into being. These legends reveal a deep respect for the polar bear, which is portrayed as both spiritually powerful and closely akin to humans. The human-like posture of bears when standing and sitting, and the resemblance of a skinned bear carcass to the human body, have probably contributed to the belief that the spirits of humans and bears were interchangeable. Eskimo legends tell of humans learning to hunt from the polar bear.Among the Chukchi and Yupik of eastern Siberia, there was a longstanding shamanistic ritual of \"thanksgiving\" to the hunted polar bear. After killing the animal, its head and skin were removed and cleaned and brought into the home, a feast was held in the hunting camp in its honor. In order to appease the spirit of the bear, there were traditional song and drum music and the skull would be ceremonially fed and offered a pipe. Only once the spirit was appeased would the skull be separated from the skin, taken beyond the bounds of the homestead, and placed in the ground, facing north. Many of these traditions have faded somewhat in time, especially in light of the total hunting ban in the Soviet Union (and now Russia) since 1955.The Nenets of north-central Siberia placed particular value on the talismanic power of the prominent canine teeth. They were traded in the villages of the lower Yenisei and Khatanga rivers to the forest-dwelling peoples further south, who would sew them into their hats as protection against brown bears. It was believed that the \"little nephew\" (the brown bear) would not dare to attack a man wearing the tooth of its powerful \"big uncle\" (the polar bear). The skulls of killed polar bears were buried at specific sacred sites and altars, called sedyangi, were constructed out of the skulls. Several such sites have been preserved on the Yamal Peninsula. Symbols and mascotsTheir distinctive appearance and their association with the Arctic have made polar bears popular icons, especially in those areas where they are native. The Canadian Toonie (two-dollar coin) features the image of a polar bear and both the Northwest Territories and Nunavut license plates in Canada are in the shape of a polar bear. The polar bear is the mascot of Bowdoin College in Maine and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (see also Alaska Nanooks) and was chosen as mascot for the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary.Companies such as Coca-Cola, Polar Beverages, Nelvana, Bundaberg Rum or Good Humor-Breyers have used images of the polar bear in advertising, while Fox's Glacier Mints have featured a polar bear named Peppy as the brand mascot since 1922. FictionPolar bears are also popular in fiction, particularly in books aimed at children or teenagers. For example, The Polar Bear Son is adapted from a traditional Inuit tale. Polar bears feature prominently in East (also released as North Child) by Edith Pattou,East (2003), A novel by Edith Pattou, Fantastic Fiction The Bear by Raymond Briggs (adapted into an animated short in 1998),The Bear, Toonhound and Chris d'Lacey's The Fire Within series.The Fire Within, Chris d'Lacey's official website The panserbj\u00f8rne of Philip Pullman's fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials are sapient, dignified polar bears who exhibit anthropomorphic qualities, and feature prominently in the 2007 film adaptation of The Golden Compass. The television series Lost features polar bears living on the tropical island setting."}, {"description": "Indigenous people Polar bears have long provided important raw materials for Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, Yupik, Chukchi, Nenets, Russian Pomors and others. Hunters commonly used teams of dogs to distract the bear, allowing the hunter to spear the bear or shoot it with arrows at closer range. Almost all parts of captured animals had a use. The fur was used in particular to sew trousers and, by the Nenets, to make galoshes-like outer footwear called tobok; the meat is edible, despite some risk of trichinosis; the fat was used in food and as a fuel for lighting homes, alongside seal and whale blubber; sinews were used as thread for sewing clothes; the gallbladder and sometimes heart were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; the large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. Only the liver was not used, as its high concentration of vitamin A is poisonous.As a carnivore which feeds largely upon fish-eating carnivores, the polar bear ingests large amounts of vitamin A, which is stored in their livers. The resulting high concentrations cause Hypervitaminosis A, Hunters make sure to either toss the liver into the sea or bury it in order to spare their dogs from potential poisoning. Traditional subsistence hunting was on a small enough scale to not significantly affect polar bear populations, mostly because of the sparseness of the human population in polar bear habitat. History of commercial harvestIn Russia, polar bear furs were already being commercially traded in the 14th century, though it was of low value compared to Arctic Fox or even reindeer fur. The growth of the human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th century, together with the advent of firearms and increasing trade, dramatically increased the harvest of polar bears. However, since polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role, data on the historical harvest is fragmentary. It is known, for example, that already in the winter of 1784/1785 Russian Pomors on Spitsbergen harvested 150 polar bears in Magdalenefjorden. In the early 20th century, Norwegian hunters were harvesting 300 bears a year at the same location. Estimates of total historical harvest suggest that from the beginning of the 18th century, roughly 400 to 500 animals were being harvested annually in northern Eurasia, reaching a peak of 1,300 to 1,500 animals in the early 20th century, and falling off as the numbers began dwindling.In the first half of the 20th century, mechanized and overpoweringly efficient methods of hunting and trapping came into use in North America as well. Polar bears were chased from snowmobiles, icebreakers, and airplanes, the latter practice described in a 1965 New York Times editorial as being \"about as sporting as machine gunning a cow.\"Bruemmer, pp. 93\u2013111 The numbers taken grew rapidly in the 1960s, peaking around 1968 with a global total of 1,250 bears that year. Contemporary regulations Concerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. In 1973, the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, 15 November 1973, Oslo The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the Cold War. Biologist Ian Stirling commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear.\"Stirling, Ian Foreword inAgreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and Chukotka. The treaty was ratified in October 2007. RussiaThe Soviet Union banned the harvest of polar bears in 1956, however poaching continued and is believed to pose a serious threat to the polar bear population. In recent years, polar bears have approached coastal villages in Chukotka more frequently due to the shrinking of the sea ice, endangering humans and raising concerns that illegal hunting would become even more prevalent. In 2007, the Russian government made subsistence hunting legal for Chukotka natives only, a move supported by Russia's most prominent bear researchers and the World Wide Fund for Nature as a means to curb poaching. GreenlandIn Greenland, hunting restrictions were first introduced in 1994 and expanded by executive order in 2005. Until 2005 Greenland placed no limit on hunting by indigenous people. However, in 2006 it imposed a limit of 150, while also allowed recreational hunting for the first time.Naomi A. Rose Hitting Polar Bears When They Are Down. The Humane Society of the United States. 16 February 2006 Other provisions included year-round protection of cubs and mothers, restrictions on weapons used, and various administrative requirements to catalogue kills. Canada About 500 bears are killed per year by humans across Canada,Aaars, pp. 101\u2013116 a rate believed by scientists to be unsustainable for some areas, notably Baffin Bay. Canada has allowed sport hunters accompanied by local guides and dog-sled teams since 1970, but the practice was not common until the 1980s. The guiding of sport hunters provides meaningful employment and an important source of income for native communities in which economic opportunities are few. Sport hunting can bring CDN$20,000 to $35,000 per bear into northern communities, which until recently has been mostly from American hunters.The territory of Nunavut accounts for the location 80% of annual kills in Canada. In 2005, the government of Nunavut increased the quota from 400 to 518 bears, despite protests from some scientific groups. In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient. While most of that quota is hunted by the indigenous Inuit people, a growing share is sold to recreational hunters. (0.8% in the 1970s, 7.1% in the 1980s, and 14.6% in the 1990s) Nunavut polar bear biologist, Mitchell Taylor, who was formerly responsible for polar bear conservation in the territory, insists that bear numbers are being sustained under current hunting limits. In 2010, the 2005 increase was partially reversed. Government of Nunavut officials announced that the polar bear quota for the Baffin Bay region would be gradually reduced from 105 per year to 65 by the year 2013. The Government of the Northwest Territories maintain their own quota of 72 to 103 bears within the Inuvialuit communities of which some are set aside for sports hunters. Environment Canada also banned the export from Canada of fur, claws, skulls and other products from polar bears harvested in Baffin Bay as of 1 January 2010.Because of the way polar bear hunting quotas are managed in Canada, attempts to discourage sport hunting would actually increase the number of bears killed in the short term. Canada allocates a certain number of permits each year to sport and subsistence hunting, and those that are not used for sport hunting are re-allocated to Native subsistence hunting. Whereas Native communities kill all the polar bears they are permitted to take each year, only half of sport hunters with permits actually manage to kill a polar bear. If a sport hunter does not kill a polar bear before his or her permit expires, the permit cannot be transferred to another hunter. United StatesThe Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 afforded polar bears some protection in the United States. It banned hunting (except by indigenous substinence hunters), banned importing of polar bear parts (except polar bear pelts taken legally in Canada), and banned the harassment of polar bears. On 15 May 2008, the United States department of Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act and banned all importing of polar bear trophies. Importing products made from polar bears had been prohibited from 1972 to 1994 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and restricted between 1994 and 2008. Under those restrictions, permits from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) were required to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies taken in hunting expeditions in Canada. The permit process required that the bear be taken from an area with quotas based on sound management principles. Since 1994, more than 800 sport-hunted polar bear trophies have been imported into the U.S.The Humane Society of the United States \"Support the Polar Bear Protection Act\""}, {"description": "The polar bear is a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea. However, it is the only living \"marine mammal\" with powerful, large limbs and feet that allow them to cover miles on foot and run on land. Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas, known as the \"Arctic ring of life\", have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic. The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water, such as polynyas and leads (temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice), to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet. Polar bears are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack, rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low.Matthews, p. 15Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes. Seals migrate in response to these changes, and polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as \"ice-floe breakup\"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up. In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round."}, {"description": "Although seal predation is the primary and an indispensable way of life for most polar bears, when alternatives are present they are quite flexible. Polar bears will consume a wide variety of other wild foods, including muskox (Ovibos moschatus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus),. birds, eggs, rodents, crabs, other crustaceans and other polar bears. They may also eat plants,. including berries, roots, and kelp, however none of these are a significant part of their diet, except that beachcast marine mammal carcasses are an exception.Harington 2008 When stalking land animals, such as muskox, reindeer. and even willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), polar bears appear to make use of vegetative cover and wind direction to bring them as close to their prey as possible before attacking. Polar bears have been observed to hunt the small Svalbard reindeer (R. t. platyrhynchus), which weigh only 40 to as adults, as well as the Barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus), which is about twice as heavy as that.Derocher, A. E., Wiig, \u00d8., & Bangjord, G. (2000). Predation of Svalbard reindeer by polar bears. Polar Biology, 23(10), 675\u2013678.Brook, R. K., & Richardson, E. S. (2002). Observations of polar bear predatory behaviour toward caribou. Arctic, 193\u2013196. Adult muskox, which can weigh 450 kg or more, are a more formidable quarry.Ovsyanikov, N.G. 1996. Interactions of polar bears with otherlarge mammals, including man. Journal of Wildlife Research, 1:254\u2013259. Although ungulates are not typical prey, the killing of one during the summer months can greatly increase the odds of survival during that lean period. Like the brown bear, most ungulate prey of polar bears is likely to be young, sickly or injured specimens rather than healthy adults. The polar bear's biology is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals, and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food.In their southern range, especially near Hudson Bay and James Bay Canada polar bears live all summer without sea ice. Here their food ecology shows their dietary flexibility. They still manage to consume some seals, but they are food-deprived in summer as only marine mammal carcasses are an important alternative without sea ice,Harington, C.R. 2008 especially carcasses of the bowhead whale. These alternatives may reduce the rate of weight loss of bears when on land. One scientist found that 71% of the Hudson Bay bears had fed on seaweed (marine algae) and that about half were feeding on birds like sea ducks, especially the oldsquaw (53%), common eider, long-tailed duck or dovekieby swimming underwater to catch them. They were also diving to feed on blue mussels and other underwater food sources like the green sea urchin. 24% had eaten moss recently, 19% had consumed grass, 34% had eaten black crowberry and about half had consumed willows. This study illustrates the polar bear's dietary flexibility but it does not represent its life history elsewhere. Most polar bears elsewhere will never have access to these alternatives, except for the marine mammal carcasses that are important wherever they occur. Behavior Unlike grizzly bears, polar bears are not territorial. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight.Matthews, pp. 27\u201329 Satiated polar bears rarely attack humans unless severely provoked. However, due to their lack of prior human interaction, hungry polar bears are extremely unpredictable, fearless towards people and are known to kill and sometimes eat humans.Bruemmer, pp. 25\u201333 Many attacks by brown bears are the result of surprising the animal, which is not the case with the polar bear. Polar bears are stealth hunters, and the victim is often unaware of the bear's presence until the attack is underway. Whereas brown bears often maul a person and then leave, polar bear attacks are more likely to be predatory and are almost always fatal. However, due to the very small human population around the Arctic, such attacks are rare. Michio Hoshino, a Japanese wildlife photographer, was once pursued briefly by a hungry male polar bear in northern Alaska. According to Hoshino, the bear started running but Hoshino made it to his truck. The bear was able to reach the truck and tore one of the doors off the truck before Hoshino was able to drive off.Hoshino, M. Hoshino's Alaska. Chronicle Books (2007), ISBN 0811856518.In general, adult polar bears live solitary lives. Yet, they have often been seen playing together for hours at a time and even sleeping in an embrace, and polar bear zoologist Nikita Ovsianikov has described adult males as having \"well-developed friendships.\" Cubs are especially playful as well. Among young males in particular, play-fighting may be a means of practicing for serious competition during mating seasons later in life.Matthews, p. 95 Polar bears have a wide range of vocalisations, including bellows, roars, growls, chuffs and purrs.Bear Behaviour and Activities from Gary Brown's The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993In 1992, a photographer near Churchill took a now widely circulated set of photographs of a polar bear playing with a Canadian Eskimo Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) a tenth of its size.Why Didn't the Wild Polar Bear eat the Husky? The National Institute for Play The pair wrestled harmlessly together each afternoon for ten days in a row for no apparent reason, although the bear may have been trying to demonstrate its friendliness in the hope of sharing the kennel's food.Rosing, pp. 128\u2013132 This kind of social interaction is uncommon; it is far more typical for polar bears to behave aggressively towards dogs. Reproduction and lifecycle Courtship and mating take place on the sea ice in April and May, when polar bears congregate in the best seal hunting areas. A male may follow the tracks of a breeding female for 100 km or more, and after finding her engage in intense fighting with other males over mating rights, fights which often result in scars and broken teeth. Polar bears have a generally polygynous mating system; recent genetic testing of mothers and cubs, however, has uncovered cases of litters in which cubs have different fathers. Partners stay together and mate repeatedly for an entire week; the mating ritual induces ovulation in the female.Rosing, pp. 42\u201348After mating, the fertilized egg remains in a suspended state until August or September. During these four months, the pregnant female eats prodigious amounts of food, gaining at least 200 kg and often more than doubling her body weight. Maternity denning and early life When the ice floes break up in the fall, ending the possibility of hunting, each pregnant female digs a maternity den consisting of a narrow entrance tunnel leading to one to three chambers. Most maternity dens are in snowdrifts, but may also be made underground in permafrost if it is not sufficiently cold yet for snow. In most subpopulations, maternity dens are situated on land a few kilometers from the coast, and the individuals in a subpopulation tend to reuse the same denning areas each year. The polar bears that do not den on land make their dens on the sea ice. In the den, she enters a dormant state similar to hibernation. This hibernation-like state does not consist of continuous sleeping; however, the bear's heart rate slows from 46 to 27 beats per minute.Lockwood, pp.17\u201321 Her body temperature does not decrease during this period as it would for a typical mammal in hibernation.Between November and February, cubs are born blind, covered with a light down fur, and weighing less than 0.9 kg, but in captivity they might be delivered in the earlier months. The earliest recorded birth of polar bears in captivity was on 11 October 2011 in the Toronto Zoo. On average, each litter has two cubs. The family remains in the den until mid-February to mid-April, with the mother maintaining her fast while nursing her cubs on a fat-rich milk. By the time the mother breaks open the entrance to the den, her cubs weigh about 10 to. For about 12 to 15 days, the family spends time outside the den while remaining in its vicinity, the mother grazing on vegetation while the cubs become used to walking and playing. Then they begin the long walk from the denning area to the sea ice, where the mother can once again catch seals. Depending on the timing of ice-floe breakup in the fall, she may have fasted for up to eight months. Cubs may fall prey to wolves or to starvation. Female polar bears are noted for both their affection towards their offspring, and their valiance in protecting them. One case of adoption of a wild cub has been confirmed by genetic testing. Adult male bears occasionally kill and eat polar bear cubs,Derocher, AE and Wiig, Oe; Infanticide and Cannibalism of Juvenile Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus) in Svalbard Arctic [Arctic]. Vol. 52, no. 3, pp. 307\u2013310. Sep 1999 for reasons that are unclear. As of 2006, in Alaska, 42% of cubs now reach 12 months of age, down from 65% 15 years ago. In most areas, cubs are weaned at two and a half years of age, when the mother chases them away or abandons them. The western coast of Hudson Bay is unusual in that its female polar bears sometimes wean their cubs at only one and a half years. This was the case for 40% of cubs there in the early 1980s; however by the 1990s, fewer than 20% of cubs were weaned this young. After the mother leaves, sibling cubs sometimes travel and share food together for weeks or months. Later lifeFemales begin to breed at the age of four years in most areas, and five years in the Beaufort Sea area. Males usually reach sexual maturity at six years; however, as competition for females is fierce, many do not breed until the age of eight or ten. A study in Hudson Bay indicated that both the reproductive success and the maternal weight of females peaked in their mid-teens.Maternal success appeared to decline after this point, possibly because of an age-related impairment in the ability to store the fat necessary to rear cubs.Polar bears appear to be less affected by infectious diseases and parasites than most terrestrial mammals. Polar bears are especially susceptible to Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm they contract through cannibalism, although infections are usually not fatal. Only one case of a polar bear with rabies has been documented, even though polar bears frequently interact with Arctic foxes, which often carry rabies. Bacterial Leptospirosis and Morbillivirus have been recorded. Polar bears sometimes have problems with various skin diseases which may be caused by mites or other parasites. Life expectancyPolar bears rarely live beyond 25 years.Hemstock, pp. 29\u201335 The oldest wild bears on record died at age 32, whereas the oldest captive was a female who died in 1991, age 43. The causes of death in wild adult polar bears are poorly understood, as carcasses are rarely found in the species's frigid habitat. In the wild, old polar bears eventually become too weak to catch food, and gradually starve to death. Polar bears injured in fights or accidents may either die from their injuries or become unable to hunt effectively, leading to starvation. Ecological roleThe polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic Foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills.The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The baby fur of most Arctic seal species is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic seals all have dark fur at birth.Polar bears rarely enter conflict with other predators, though recent brown bear encroachments into polar bear territories have led to antagonistic encounters. Brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses,Dough O'Harra Polar bears, grizzlies increasingly gather on North Slope. Anchorage Daily News. 24 April 2005 and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens. Wolves are rarely encountered by polar bears, though there are two records of Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos) packs killing polar bear cubs. A rather unlikely killer of a grown polar bear has reportedly included a wolverine (Gulo gulo), anecedotely reported to have suffocated a bear with a bite to the throat during a conflict over food. Polar bears are sometimes the host of arctic mites such as Alaskozetes antarcticus. Long distance swimmerResearchers tracked 52 sows in the southern Beaufort Sea off Alaska with GPS system collars; no boars were involved in the study due to males' necks being too thick for the GPS-equipped collars. Fifty long-distance swims were recorded; the longest at 354 km, with an average of 155 km. The length of these swims ranged from most of a day to ten days. Ten of the sows had a cub swim with them and after a year six cubs survived. The study did not determine if the others lost their cubs before, during, or some time after their long swims. Researchers do not know whether or not this is a new behavior; before polar ice shrinkage, they opined that there was probably neither the need nor opportunity to swim such long distances."}, {"description": "Estimates of the status of the global population of polar bears vary widely. As of 2008, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reports that the global population of polar bears is 20,000 to 25,000, and is declining. In 2006, the IUCN upgraded the polar bear from a species of least concern to a vulnerable species. It cited a \"suspected population reduction of >30% within three generations (45 years)\". However, a report published in July 2013, estimates that the global population of polar bears increased by an average of almost 4,200 bears since 2001. Risks to the polar bear include climate change, pollution in the form of toxic contaminants, conflicts with shipping, stresses from recreational polar-bear watching, and oil and gas exploration and development. The IUCN also cited a \"potential risk of over-harvest\" through legal and illegal hunting.According to the World Wildlife Fund, the polar bear is important as an indicator of arctic ecosystem health. Polar bears are studied to gain understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic, because at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the arctic marine ecosystem.WWF: A Leader in Polar Bear Conservation . Retrieved 29 June 2009, from WFF \u2013 Polar Bear Web site: http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/polarbear/polarbear.html# Climate changeThe IUCN, Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, United States Geological Survey and many leading polar bear biologists have expressed grave concerns about the impact of climate change, including the belief that the current warming trend imperils the survival of the species.T. Appenzeller and D. R. Dimick, \"The Heat is On,\" National Geographic 206 (2004): 2\u201375. cited in. The relevant paper is Key Finding 4 The polar bear has survived several periods warmer than at present.The key danger posed by climate change is malnutrition or starvation due to habitat loss. Polar bears hunt seals from a platform of sea ice. Rising temperatures cause the sea ice to melt earlier in the year, driving the bears to shore before they have built sufficient fat reserves to survive the period of scarce food in the late summer and early fall. Reduction in sea-ice cover also forces bears to swim longer distances, which further depletes their energy stores and occasionally leads to drowning. Thinner sea ice tends to deform more easily, which appears to make it more difficult for polar bears to access seals. Insufficient nourishment leads to lower reproductive rates in adult females and lower survival rates in cubs and juvenile bears, in addition to poorer body condition in bears of all ages. In addition to creating nutritional stress, a warming climate is expected to affect various other aspects of polar bear life: Changes in sea ice affect the ability of pregnant females to build suitable maternity dens. As the distance increases between the pack ice and the coast, females must swim longer distances to reach favored denning areas on land. Thawing of permafrost would affect the bears who traditionally den underground, and warm winters could result in den roofs collapsing or having reduced insulative value. For the polar bears that currently den on multi-year ice, increased ice mobility may result in longer distances for mothers and young cubs to walk when they return to seal-hunting areas in the spring. Disease-causing bacteria and parasites would flourish more readily in a warmer climate.Problematic interactions between polar bears and humans, such as foraging by bears in garbage dumps, have historically been more prevalent in years when ice-floe breakup occurred early and local polar bears were relatively thin. Increased human-bear interactions, including fatal attacks on humans, are likely to increase as the sea ice shrinks and hungry bears try to find food on land.Mitchell Taylor, a former polar bear researcher for the Nunavut government, believes that arctic warming has been caused by natural phenomena and is not a long-term threat to the polar bear. After his retirement, he was not re-appointed to the international Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), giving rise to speculation that he was excluded from the group because of his views on climate change. According to the PBSG chair, appointments to the PBSG are given to scientists who are currently active in polar bear research, and that as a retired researcher Taylor did not qualify. (References: ) The effects of climate change are most profound in the southern part of the polar bear's range, and this is indeed where significant degradation of local populations has been observed. The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, in a southern part of the range, also happens to be one of the best-studied polar bear subpopulations. This subpopulation feeds heavily on ringed seals in late spring, when newly weaned and easily hunted seal pups are abundant. The late spring hunting season ends for polar bears when the ice begins to melt and break up, and they fast or eat little during the summer until the sea freezes again.Due to warming air temperatures, ice-floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago, reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season. The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period; the average weight of lone (and likely pregnant) female polar bears was approximately 290 kg in 1980 and 230 kg in 2004. Between 1987 and 2004, the Western Hudson Bay population declined by 22%.In Alaska, the effects of sea ice shrinkage have contributed to higher mortality rates in polar bear cubs, and have led to changes in the denning locations of pregnant females.The proportion of maternity dens on sea ice has changed from 62% between the years 1985 through 1994, to 37% over the years 1998 through 2004. Thus now the Alaskan population more resembles the world population in that it is more likely to den on land. In recent years, polar bears in the Arctic have undertaken longer than usual swims to find prey, resulting in four recorded drownings in the unusually large ice pack regression of 2005. PollutionPolar bears accumulate high levels of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides. Due to their position at the top of the food pyramid, with a diet heavy in blubber in which halocarbons concentrate, their bodies are among the most contaminated of Arctic mammals. Halocarbons are known to be toxic to other animals, because they mimic hormone chemistry, and biomarkers such as immunoglobulin G and retinol suggest similar effects on polar bears. PCBs have received the most study, and they have been associated with birth defects and immune system deficiency.The most notorious of these chemicals, such as PCBs and DDT, have been internationally banned. Their concentrations in polar bear tissues continued to rise for decades after the ban as these chemicals spread through the food chain. But the trend seems to have abated, with tissue concentrations of PCBs declining between studies performed from 1989 to 1993 and studies performed from 1996 to 2002. Oil and gas developmentOil and gas development in polar bear habitat can affect the bears in a variety of ways. An oil spill in the Arctic would most likely concentrate in the areas where polar bears and their prey are also concentrated, such as sea ice leads. Because polar bears rely partly on their fur for insulation and soiling of the fur by oil reduces its insulative value, oil spills put bears at risk of dying from hypothermia. Polar bears exposed to oil spill conditions have been observed to lick the oil from their fur, leading to fatal kidney failure. Maternity dens, used by pregnant females and by females with infants, can also be disturbed by nearby oil exploration and development. Disturbance of these sensitive sites may trigger the mother to abandon her den prematurely, or abandon her litter altogether. PredictionsThe U.S. Geological Survey predicts two-thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear by 2050, based on moderate projections for the shrinking of summer sea ice caused by climate change. The bears would disappear from Europe, Asia, and Alaska, and be depleted from the Arctic archipelago of Canada and areas off the northern Greenland coast. By 2080, they would disappear from Greenland entirely and from the northern Canadian coast, leaving only dwindling numbers in the interior Arctic archipelago.Predictions vary on the extent to which polar bears could adapt to climate change by switching to terrestrial food sources. Mitchell Taylor, who was director of Wildlife Research for the Government of Nunavut, wrote to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service arguing that local studies are insufficient evidence for global protection at this time. The letter stated, \"At present, the polar bear is one of the best managed of the large Arctic mammals. If all Arctic nations continue to abide by the terms and intent of the Polar Bear Agreement, the future of polar bears is secure\u00a0... Clearly polar bears can adapt to climate change. They have evolved and persisted for thousands of years in a period characterized by fluctuating climate.\" Ken Taylor, deputy commissioner for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, has said, \"I wouldn't be surprised if polar bears learned to feed on spawning salmon like grizzly bears.\"However, many scientists consider these theories to be naive; it is noted that black and brown bears at high latitudes are smaller than elsewhere, because of the scarcity of terrestrial food resources. An additional risk to the species is that if individuals spend more time on land, they will hybridize with brown or grizzly bears. The IUCN wrote: Controversy over species protectionWarnings about the future of the polar bear are often contrasted with the fact that worldwide population estimates have increased over the past 50 years and are relatively stable today. Some estimates of the global population are around 5,000 to 10,000 in the early 1970s; other estimates were 20,000 to 40,000 during the 1980s. Current estimates put the global population at between 20,000 and 25,000.There are several reasons for the apparent discordance between past and projected population trends: estimates from the 1950s and 1960s were based on stories from explorers and hunters rather than on scientific surveys.Bruemmer, p. 101. In a meeting of the five circumpolar nations on 6 September 1965, estimates of the worldwide population ranged from 5,000 to 19,000. \"The truth was, no one knew... Scientific research had been sketchy and knowledge of the polar bear was based largely on stories brought back by explorers and hunters.\" Second, controls of harvesting were introduced that allowed this previously overhunted species to recover. Third, the recent effects of climate change have affected sea ice abundance in different areas to varying degrees. Finally, the prediction methods used to predict the decline in the future population of bears excluded key forecasting principles and included questionable assumptions.Debate over the listing of the polar bear under endangered species legislation has put conservation groups and Canada's Inuit at opposing positions; the Nunavut government and many northern residents have condemned the U.S. initiative to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. Many Inuit believe the polar bear population is increasing, and restrictions on sport-hunting are likely to lead to a loss of income to their communities.Northern Research Forum.

Around the Beaufort Sea, however, mature males reportedly average 450 kg.Derocher, A. E., & Wiig, \u00d8. (2002). Postnatal growth in body length and mass of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) at Svalbard. Journal of Zoology, 256(3), 343\u2013349. Adult females are roughly half the size of males and normally weigh 150 -, measuring 1.8 - in length. Elsewhere, a slightly larger estimated average weight of 260 kg was claimed for adult females.Ferguson, S. H., Taylor, M. K., Born, E. W., Rosing\u2010Asvid, A., & Messier, F. (1999).

The polar bear is among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals, surpassed only by the pinnipeds such as elephant seals. The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1002 kg, was a male shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960. This specimen, when mounted, stood 3.39 m tall on its hindlegs.

Retrieved 15 September 2011. While all bears are short-tailed, the polar bear's tail is relatively the shortest amongst living bears, ranging from 7 to in length.Compared with its closest relative, the brown bear, the polar bear has a more elongated body build and a longer skull and nose. As predicted by Allen's rule for a northerly animal, the legs are stocky and the ears and tail are small. However, the feet are very large to distribute load when walking on snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming; they may measure 30 cm across in an adult.Lockwood, pp. 10\u201316 The pads of the paws are covered with small, soft papillae (dermal bumps) which provide traction on the ice. The polar bear's claws are short and stocky compared to those of the brown bear, perhaps to serve the former's need to grip heavy prey and ice. The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat. Research of injury patterns in polar bear forelimbs found injuries to the right forelimb to be more frequent than those to the left, suggesting, perhaps, right-handedness. Unlike the brown bear, polar bears in captivity are rarely overweight or particularly large, possibly as a reaction to the warm conditions of most zoos.The 42 teeth of a polar bear reflect its highly carnivorous diet. The cheek teeth are smaller and more jagged than in the brown bear, and the canines are larger and sharper. The dental formula is Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm of blubber, their hide and their fur; they overheat at temperatures above 10 \u00b0C, and are nearly invisible under infrared photography. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. The guard hair is 5 - over most of the body. Polar bears gradually moult from May to August,Kolenosky G. B. 1987. Polar bear. pp. 475\u2013485 in Wild furbearer management and conservation in North America (M. Novak, J. A. Baker, M. E. Obbard, and B. Malloch, eds.). Ontario Fur Trappers Association, North Bay, Ontario, Canada. but, unlike other Arctic mammals, they do not shed their coat for a darker shade to camouflage themselves in the summer conditions. The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat were once thought to act as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin, where it could be absorbed; however, this theory was disproven by recent studies.The white coat usually yellows with age. When kept in captivity in warm, humid conditions, the fur may turn a pale shade of green due to algae growing inside the guard hairs.In unusually warm conditions, the hollow tubes provide an excellent home for algae. While the algae is harmless to the bears, it is often a worry to the zoos housing them, and affected animals are sometimes washed in a salt solution, or mild peroxide bleach to make the fur white again. Males have significantly longer hairs on their forelegs, which increase in length until the bear reaches 14 years of age. The male's ornamental foreleg hair is thought to attract females, serving a similar function to the lion's mane.The polar bear has an extremely well developed sense of smell, being able to detect seals nearly 1 mi away and buried under 3 ft of snow.Rosing, pp. 20\u201323 Its hearing is about as acute as that of a human, and its vision is also good at long distances.The polar bear is an excellent swimmer and often will swim for days. One bear swam continuously for 9 days in the frigid Bering Sea for 687 km to reach ice far from land. She then traveled another 1800 km With its body fat providing buoyancy, the bear swims in a dog paddle fashion using its large forepaws for propulsion. Polar bears can swim 6 mph. When walking, the polar bear tends to have a lumbering gait and maintains an average speed of around 3.5 mph. When sprinting, they can reach up to 25 mph.Polar Bears: VI. Behavior., SeaWorld. Retrieved 21 January 2011. Hunting and diet The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and throughout most of its range, its diet primarily consists of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus). The Arctic is home to millions of seals, which become prey when they surface in holes in the ice in order to breathe, or when they haul out on the ice to rest.Matthews, pp. 73\u201388 Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water.The polar bear's most common hunting method is called still-hunting:Hemstock, pp. 24\u201327 The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to locate a seal breathing hole, and crouches nearby in silence for a seal to appear. The bear may lay in wait for several hours. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear kills the seal by biting its head to crush its skull. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice: Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within 100 yd, and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within 30 to of the seal and then suddenly rushes forth to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow.A widespread legend tells that polar bears cover their black noses with their paws when hunting. This behavior, if it happens, is rare \u2013 although the story exists in native oral history and in accounts by early Arctic explorers, there is no record of an eyewitness account of the behavior in recent decades. Mature bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat. Studies have also photographed polar bears scaling near-vertical cliffs, to eat birds' chicks and eggs.(Lono 1957Pedersen 1962 For subadult bears which are independent of their mother but have not yet gained enough experience and body size to successfully hunt seals, scavenging the carcasses from other bears' kills is an important source of nutrition. Subadults may also be forced to accept a half-eaten carcass if they kill a seal but cannot defend it from larger polar bears. After feeding, polar bears wash themselves with water or snow.The polar bear is perhaps unequaled by any other living land predator in its enormous physical power. However, its primary prey species, the ringed seal, is much smaller than itself, and many of the seals hunted are pups rather than adults. Ringed seals are born weighing 5.4 kg and grown to an estimated average weight of only 60 kg.Rosing-Asvid, A. (2006). The influence of climate variability on polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and ringed seal (Pusa hispida) population dynamics. Canadian journal of zoology, 84(3), 357\u2013364.Derocher, A. E., Wiig, \u00d8., & Andersen, M. (2002). Diet composition of polar bears in Svalbard and the western Barents Sea. Polar Biology, 25(6), 448\u2013452. They also in places prey heavily upon the harp seal (Pusa groenlandica) or the harbor seal. The bearded seal, on the other hand, can be nearly the same size as the bear itself, averaging 270 kg. Adult male bearded seals, at 350 to are believed to be too large for a female bear to overtake, and so are potential prey only for mature male bears.Thiemann, G. W., Budge, S. M., Iverson, S. J., & Stirling, I. (2007). Unusual fatty acid biomarkers reveal age-and sex-specific foraging in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Canadian Journal of Zoology, 85(4), 505\u2013517. Enormously powerful large males also occasionally attempt to hunt and kill even larger prey items.Thiemann, G. W., Iverson, S. J., Stirling, I., & Obbard, M. E. (2011). Individual patterns of prey selection and dietary specialization in an Arctic marine carnivore\" Oikos 120(10), 1469\u20131478. It can kill an adult walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), although this is rarely attempted. At up to 2000 kg and a typical adult mass range of 600 to, a walrus can be more than twice the bear's weight, and has up to 3 ft-long ivory tusks that can be used as formidable weapons. A polar bear may charge a group of walruses, with the goal of separating a young, infirm, or injured walrus from the pod. They will even attack adult walruses when their diving holes have frozen over or intercept them before they can get back to the diving hole in the ice. Yet, polar bears will very seldom attack full-grown adult walruses, with the largest male walrus probably invulnerable unless otherwise injured or incapacitated. Since an attack on a walrus tends to be an extremely protracted and exhausting venture, bears have been known to back down from the attack after making the initial injury to the walrus. Polar bears have also been seen to prey on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros), by swiping at them at breathing holes. The whales are of similar size to the walrus and nearly as difficult for the bear to subdue.Heyland, J. D., & Hay, K. (1976). An attack by a polar bear on a juvenile beluga. Arctic, 29(1), 56\u201357. Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear on land as polar bears overheat quickly, and most marine animals the bear encounters can outswim it. In some areas, the polar bear's diet is supplemented by walrus calves and by the carcasses of dead adult walruses or whales, whose blubber is readily devoured even when rotten. Polar bears sometimes like to go fishing where they swim underwater to catch fish like the arctic charr or the Fourhorn sculpin. With the exception of pregnant females, polar bears are active year-round, although they have a vestigial hibernation induction trigger in their blood. Unlike brown and black bears, polar bears are capable of fasting for up to several months during late summer and early fall, when they cannot hunt for seals because the sea is unfrozen. When sea ice is unavailable during summer and early autumn, some populations live off fat reserves for months at a time. Being both curious animals and scavengers, polar bears investigate and consume garbage where they come into contact with humans. Polar bears may attempt to consume almost anything they can find, including hazardous substances such as styrofoam, plastic, car batteries, ethylene glycol, hydraulic fluid, and motor oil. The dump in Churchill, Manitoba was closed in 2006 to protect bears, and waste is now recycled or transported to Thompson, Manitoba."}, {"description": "The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).(Overview page) A boar (adult male) weighs around 350 \u2013, while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting the seals which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time at sea. Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\", and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present.The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, with eight of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations in decline.IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group, 2009.15th meeting of PBSG in Copenhagen, Denmark 2009: Press Release. Retrieved 10 January 2010. For decades, large scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of Arctic indigenous peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures."}]}

The tunnel systems built by naked mole-rats can stretch up to three to five kilometres (2\u20133\u00a0mi) in cumulative length. RolesThe naked mole-rat is the first mammal discovered to exhibit eusociality. This eusocial structure is similar to that found in ants, termites, and some bees and wasps. Only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony function as workers. The queen and breeding males are able to breed at one year of age. Workers are sterile, with the smaller focusing on gathering food and maintaining the nest, while larger workers are more reactive in case of attack. The non-reproducing females have appeared to be reproductively suppressed, meaning the ovaries do not fully mature. They also do not have the same levels of certain hormones as the reproducing females. The males, on the other hand, do not show much difference in their hormone concentrations. In experiments where the reproductive female was removed or died, one of the non-reproducing females would take over and become sexually active. Along with the reproducing female and reproducing males, there are also non-reproductive individuals that make up the colony. It can be said that there are two \u201cjobs\u201d that these individuals perform. The groups that perform the jobs of infrequent or frequent workers are made up of both the non-reproducing male and non-reproducing female. There is also cooperative care that occurs for the pups of the reproducing female. This occurs through the workers keeping the pups from straying, foraging for food, grooming, contributing to extension of tunnels, and keeping them warm.The Damaraland mole-rat (Cryptomys damarensis) is the only other eusocial mammal currently known. Queen and gestationThe relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years; other females are temporarily sterile. Queens live from 13 to 18\u00a0years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors. Once established, the new queen stretches the space between the vertebrae in her backbone to become longer and ready to bear pups.Gestation is about 70\u00a0days. A litter typically ranges from three to twelve pups, but may be as large as twenty-eight. The average litter size is eleven.Counting mole-rat mammaries and hungry pups, biologists explain why naked rodents break the rules, Roger Segelken, Cornell News, August 9, 1999 In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80\u00a0days. The young are born blind and weigh about 2 g. The queen nurses them for the first month; after which the other members of the colony feed them feces until they are old enough to eat solid food. WorkersSmaller workers focus on acquiring food and maintaining tunnels, while the larger workers are more reactive in case of attacks. As in certain bee species, the workers are divided along a continuum of different worker-caste behaviors instead of discrete groups. Some function primarily as tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, and some primarily as soldiers, protecting the group from outside predators. There are two main types of worker, the \"frequent workers\" who frequently perform tasks such as foraging and nest building and \"infrequent workers\" that show role overlap with the \"frequent workers\" but perform at a much slower rate.Eusociality in a Mammal: Cooperative Breeding in Naked Mole-Rat Colonies.

ColoniesColonies range in size from 20 to 300 individuals, with an average of 75.The Naked Truth About Mole-Rats, Jill Locantore, Smithsonian Zoogoer, May/June 2002 Diet Naked mole-rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as a thousand times the body weight of a typical mole-rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations, but also eat their own feces. A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food\u2014lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines ferment the fibres, allowing otherwise indigestible cellulose to be turned into volatile fatty acids."}, {"description": "The naked mole-rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat: its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about 2/3 that of a similarly sized mouse, thus using oxygen minimally. In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, its metabolic rate can be reduced by up to 25 percent. Thermoregulation The naked mole-rat does not regulate its body temperature in typical mammalian fashion, homeostasis. They are thermoconformers rather than thermoregulators in that, unlike other mammals, body temperature tracks ambient temperatures. The relationship between oxygen consumption and ambient temperature, however, switches from a typical poikilothermic pattern to a homeothermic mode when temperature is at 28\u00a0\u00b0C or higher. At lower temperatures, they use behavioral thermoregulation, as when cold, naked mole-rats huddle together or bask in the shallow, more sun-warmed parts of their burrow systems. Conversely, when they get too hot, they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of their tunnel system. Pain insensitivityThe skin of naked mole-rats lacks a key neurotransmitter called substance P that is responsible in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. The naked mole-rats feel no pain when they are exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.Naked mole-rats' substance P deficiency has also been tied to their lack of the histamine-induced itching and scratching behavior typical of rodents. Resistance to cancerNaked mole-rats appear to have a high resistance to tumours; cancer has never been observed in them. A potential mechanism that averts cancer is an \"over-crowding\" gene, p16, which prevents cell division once individual cells come into contact (known as \"contact inhibition\"). The cells of most mammals, including naked mole-rats, undergo contact inhibition via the gene p27 which prevents cellular reproduction at a much higher cell density than p16 does. The combination of p16 and p27 in naked mole-rat cells is a double barrier to uncontrolled cell proliferation, one of the hallmarks of cancer.On June 19, 2013, scientists reported that the reason naked mole-rats do not get cancer may be because they produce an \"extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan\" (HMW-HA) (a natural sugary substance), which is over \"five times larger\" than that in cancer-prone humans and cancer-susceptible laboratory animals. The breakthrough scientific report was published a month later as the cover story of the journal Nature. A few months later, the same University of Rochester research team announced that naked mole-rats have ribosomes that produce extremely error-free proteins. Because of both of these discoveries, the journal Science named the naked mole-rat \"Vertebrate of the Year\" for 2013.Blind mole-rats Spalax golani and Spalax judaei also appear to be immune to cancer but by a different mechanism. LongevityThe naked mole-rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 31\u00a0years) and holds the record for the longest living rodent. Naked mole-rats are highly resistant to cancer and maintain healthy vascular function longer in their lifespan than shorter-living rats. The reason for their longevity is debated, but is thought to be related to their ability to substantially reduce their metabolism during hard times, and so prevent aging-induced damage from oxidative stress. This has been referred to as \"living their life in pulses\". Their longevity has also been attributed to \u201cprotein stability.\u201dViviana Perez, Rochelle Buffenstein, Venkata Masamsetti, Shanique Leonard, Adam Salmon, James Mele, Blazej Andziak, Ting Yang, Yael Edrey, Bertrand Friguet, Walter Ward, Arlan Richardson, Asish Chaudhuri. \"Protein stability and resistance to oxidative stress are determinants of longevity in the longest-living rodent, the naked mole rat\". (March 3, 2009). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences This reference requires further details Because of their extraordinary longevity, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole-rat. A draft genome was made available in 2011 with an improved genome version released in 2014. Further transcriptome sequencing revealed genes related to mitochondria and oxidation reduction processes to have high levels in the naked mole-rat when compared to mice, which may contribute to their longevity. SizeReproducing females become the dominant female, usually, by founding new colonies, fighting for the dominant position, or taking over once the reproducing female dies. These reproducing females tend to have longer bodies than that of their non-reproducing counter parts of the same skull width. Interestingly enough, the measurements of females before they became reproductive and after show significant increases in body size. It is believed that this trait does not occur due to pre-existing morphological differences but to the actual attainment of the dominant female position.Young, A. J., & Bennett, N. C. (November 01, 2010). Morphological Divergence of Breeders and Helpers in Wild Damaraland Mole Rat Societies. Evolution, 64, 11, 3190-3197. As with the reproductive females, the reproductive males also appear to be bigger in size than their non-reproducing counterparts but not as much so as in the case of the females. These males also have visible outlines of the testes through the skin of their abdomens. Unlike the females, there are usually multiple reproducing males Jarvis, J. U. M., & Bennett, N. C. (1993).

Anders als bei den Graumullen, die ebenfalls hoch sozialisiertes Verhalten zeigen, sind Nacktmullk\u00f6niginnen ausgesprochen aggressiv und attackieren h\u00e4ufig ihre infertilen T\u00f6chter und S\u00f6hne.Die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Unfruchtbarkeit der Nachkommenschaft sind bislang nicht ausreichend erforscht. Einige \u00e4ltere Vermutungen gehen von einer hormonellen Unterdr\u00fcckung durch die K\u00f6nigin aus, doch diese Annahmen konnten durch einfache Versuche widerlegt werden. Eine andere Erkl\u00e4rung besagt, dass durch den Dauerstress, den die T\u00f6chter ertragen m\u00fcssen, deren Eierst\u00f6cke nicht zur Reife gelangen und sie deshalb steril bleiben. Dies erkl\u00e4rt jedoch nicht, warum es in Nacktmullkolonien nicht zu Paarungen unter den unfruchtbaren Arbeitern und Arbeiterinnen kommt.Stirbt eine Nacktmullk\u00f6nigin, so fehlt ihre Stressunterdr\u00fcckung, wodurch mehrere Arbeiterinnen fruchtbar werden und sich daraufhin gegenseitig bek\u00e4mpfen. In aller Regel siegt das Weibchen, das am schnellsten Jungtiere geb\u00e4ren kann.Die Ursachen f\u00fcr das soziale Verhalten sind nicht vollst\u00e4ndig gekl\u00e4rt. Die sogenannte Kooperationstheorie sieht darin eine Anpassung an die fleckenhaft vorkommende Nahrung im Lebensraum der Tiere. Um in dem harten Boden der Halbw\u00fcsten Nahrung zu finden, m\u00fcssen m\u00f6glichst viele Tiere auf Nahrungssuche gehen und die gefundenen Nahrungsquellen teilen. Eine neuere Hypothese geht davon aus, dass die L\u00e4nge der Tragzeit bei Nacktmullen und generell bei den Bathyergidae die Ursache f\u00fcr die Entwicklung von Eusozialit\u00e4t bei diesen Tieren war. Ein einzelnes Weibchen ist nicht in der Lage, sich gen\u00fcgend Fettvorr\u00e4te f\u00fcr die lange Trag- und Stillzeit anzufressen, und kann wegen seines gro\u00dfen K\u00f6rperumfangs in dieser Zeit die unterirdischen G\u00e4nge nur schlecht durchlaufen und nach Nahrung absuchen. Es ist somit auf die Hilfe des Partners und sp\u00e4ter der Jungen angewiesen. Die Tragzeit ist ein so konservatives Merkmal, dass sich eher die Sozialstruktur daran anpasst als umgekehrt. Die Eusozialit\u00e4t hat sich also nach dieser Theorie \u00fcber die Zwischenstufe Monogamie entwickelt."}, {"description": "Der Nacktmull (Heterocephalus glaber) ist die einzigeMaree, S., C.

Sie wiegen ungef\u00e4hr 30 bis 50 Gramm. Ihren Namen verdanken sie der Tatsache, dass ihre geringe und sehr feine Behaarung mit Ausnahme von einigen Sinneshaaren (Vibrissen) kaum wahrnehmbar ist und sie daher nackt erscheinen. Dies wird als Anpassung an ihre Lebensweise in unterirdischen Kolonien gewertet. Wegen der geringen Behaarung k\u00f6nnen sich auch Parasiten auf ihren K\u00f6rpern schlechter ansiedeln und verbreiten. Die Haut liegt lose und faltig am K\u00f6rper an und ist braun-rosa gef\u00e4rbt, wobei der R\u00fccken etwas dunkler als der Bauch ist. Die faltige Haut sch\u00fctzt zum einen die inneren Organe, wenn sich die Tiere durch sehr enge G\u00e4nge dr\u00fccken, zum anderen erm\u00f6glicht sie eine schnelle Bewegung in den Gangsystemen, wobei die Tiere sich r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts ebenso schnell bewegen k\u00f6nnen wie vorw\u00e4rts. Andere Merkmale sind die stark ausgepr\u00e4gten Schneidez\u00e4hne, die sehr gut zu erkennen sind. Mit ihnen kann der Nacktmull seine Nahrung abschneiden und zerkleinern.Nacktmulle Die Vibrissen (Tasthaare) befinden sich vor allem im Gesicht, wo die Schnurrhaare mit bis zu zwei Zentimetern die l\u00e4ngsten sind, au\u00dferdem an den Vorder- und Hinterbeinen, den Augenlidern und dem Mundbereich. Der Kopf der Tiere ist konisch mit einer abgeflachten Schnauze, nur die Region um die sehr kleinen Augen ist ausgerundet. Die Augen sind zudem von einem dicken Augenlid abgedeckt, sodass nur kleine Sehschlitze \u00fcbrigbleiben. Die visuelle Wahrnehmung ist sehr gering. Die Ohr\u00f6ffnungen sind klein und die Tiere haben keine \u00e4u\u00dferen Ohrmuscheln. Die Nasenl\u00f6cher liegen eng beieinander in einem hufeisenf\u00f6rmigen Bereich oberhalb der Nagez\u00e4hne, sie sind dabei durch eine Hautfalte abgedeckt.Als weitere Merkmale besitzen die Tiere auffallend gro\u00dfe Nagez\u00e4hne, die sie wie Baggerschaufeln einsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Hierf\u00fcr besitzen die Tiere eine sehr starke Kaumuskulatur, die die Form des Kopfes bestimmt und etwa 25 Prozent der Gesamtmuskelmasse des Tieres ausmacht. Die Nagez\u00e4hne sitzen vorne am Sch\u00e4del, vor der Lippe. Mit ihnen k\u00f6nnen Nacktmulle sich durch den harten W\u00fcstenboden graben. W\u00e4hrend die Tiere mit den Z\u00e4hnen graben, wird die Mundh\u00f6hle durch Hautfalten verschlossen, damit kein Schmutz eindringen kann. Dabei werden die Z\u00e4hne an der Spitze abgenutzt, zugleich jedoch durch das gegenseitige Abreiben auch gesch\u00e4rft. Die Nagez\u00e4hne wachsen lebenslang. Als zus\u00e4tzliche Besonderheit k\u00f6nnen Nacktmulle die Nagez\u00e4hne auch einzeln bewegen. Zudem haben die Tiere drei Backenz\u00e4hne in jedem Gebissbogen, wodurch sich eine Gebissformel von 3 \u00b7 0 \u00b7 0 \u00b7 1 | 1 \u00b7 0 \u00b7 0 \u00b7 3 ergibt.Zur Verst\u00e4ndigung untereinander benutzen die Tiere bis zu 18 verschiedene Laute, welche teilweise an Vogelzwitschern erinnern."}, {"description": "Nacktmulle \u2013 Afrikas wilde Wichte, Fernsehdokumentation von Herbert Ostwald, Deutschland 2005, 43 Minuten"}, {"description": "Eduard R\u00fcppellDie Erstbeschreibung der Nacktmulle unter dem wissenschaftlichen Namen Heterocephalus glaber (zu deutsch etwa 'Glatter Andersk\u00f6pfiger') erfolgte 1842 durch den deutschen Biologen Eduard R\u00fcppell nahe der Stadt Shewa in \u00c4thiopien. Der Artstatus der Tiere wurde in der Folge angezweifelt und mehrere Forscher gingen davon aus, dass es sich bei den beschriebenen Tieren um die nackten Jungtiere gr\u00f6\u00dferer, felltragender Nagetiere handeln m\u00fcsse. In den Folgejahren wurden jedoch durch Oldfield Thomas weitere Nacktmullarten aus verschiedenen Regionen beschrieben, die durch Glover Morrill Allen 1930 als Synonyme erkannt wurden. Dabei handelt es sich um: Heterocephalus phillipsi Thomas 1885 aus Gerlogobi, Zentral-Somaliland (heute Somalia) Heterocephalus ansorgei Thomas 1903, gefunden zwischen Ngomeni und Kjinani, Britisch-Ostafrika (heute Somalia) Fornaria phillipsi Thomas 1903 aus Mogadishu, Italienisch-Somaliland (heute Somalia) Heterocephalus dunni Thomas 1909 aus Wardairi, Zentral-Somaliland Heterocephalus stygius Allen 1912 vom Guaso Nyiro River in Britisch-Ostafrika Die Erforschung der Nacktmulle beschr\u00e4nkte sich bis zu dieser Zeit auf die reine Beschreibung der Anatomie und der Faunistik. Der britische Evolutionsphilosoph Alfred Russel Wallace bezeichnete den Nacktmull als \u201ean extraordinarily ugly species\u201c und pr\u00e4gte darauf aufbauend den Begriff Darwinistische Sackgasse. Erst 1980 entdeckte die S\u00fcdafrikanerin Jennifer Jarvis die koloniale Lebensweise der Tiere. Gemeinsam mit Richard Alexander erkl\u00e4rte sie die Eusozialit\u00e4t der Tiere, wodurch sie in den Blickpunkt einer Reihe von Forschern r\u00fcckten. Heute arbeiten vor allem Jennifer Jarvis und Paul Sherman sowie die deutschen Zoologen Hynek Burda und Thomas B. Hildebrandt an der Erforschung der Tiere."}, {"description": "Neben den bereits beschriebenen anatomischen Merkmalen weisen die Nacktmulle auch eine Reihe von physiologischen Anpassungen an ihren Lebensraum auf. AtmungEine wichtige Rolle spielt die Atmung, da es in den H\u00f6hlen der Tiere kaum Sauerstoff gibt (hypoxischer Lebensraum). Die Lungen der Tiere sind nur sehr klein ausgebildet. Daf\u00fcr hat ihr H\u00e4moglobin eine sehr hohe Sauerstoff-Affinit\u00e4t, wodurch Nacktmulle sehr effizient Sauerstoff ins Blut aufnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Hinzu kommt die sehr niedrige Atmungs- und Stoffwechselrate f\u00fcr Tiere ihrer Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, die den Sauerstoffverbrauch minimal h\u00e4lt. In l\u00e4ngeren Hungerperioden, etwa w\u00e4hrend der Trockenzeit, wird diese Rate nochmals um etwa 25 Prozent abgesenkt. W\u00e4rmeregulationNacktmulle gelten als gleichwarm, doch im Vergleich zu anderen S\u00e4ugetieren fallen vor allem die Eigenschaften eines wechselwarmen Tieres auf. Sie passen ihre K\u00f6rpertemperatur im Bereich zwischen 12 \u00b0C und 32 \u00b0C an die Umgebungstemperatur an. Dies hilft, bei den unterschiedlichen Temperaturen in ihren H\u00f6hlensystemen Energie zu sparen.Jennifer Welsh: Naked Mole Rat Genome May Hold Key to Long Life | Human Health & Longevity | Cancer Resistance & Naked Mole Rat.

M\u00e4rz 2013.W\u00e4hrend in den h\u00f6her gelegenen G\u00e4ngen die W\u00e4rme dominiert, finden die Nacktmulle Abk\u00fchlung in den tieferen und k\u00e4lteren G\u00e4ngen. Die d\u00fcnne Haut und die ebenfalls sehr d\u00fcnne Fettschicht erm\u00f6glichen eine sehr schnelle Temperaturanpassung. Einer zus\u00e4tzlichen, externen Regulation der K\u00f6rperw\u00e4rme dient das \u201eGruppenkuscheln\u201c im Nest: mehrere Tiere pressen sich eng aneinander. Ern\u00e4hrungNacktmull bei der Nahrungsaufnahme Nacktmulle trinken nicht. Das ben\u00f6tigte Wasser gewinnen sie aus ihrer Nahrung. Da diese zudem stark salzhaltig ist, besitzen Nacktmulle sehr effiziente Nieren, die einen Harn mit einer maximalen Konzentration bis zu 1,5 Mol Salz pro Kilogramm Harn herstellen k\u00f6nnen, dies entspricht 87,5 Gramm pro Liter.Die Nahrung der Nacktmulle besteht aus sehr faserigen Pflanzenknollen, die meist keinen sehr hohen N\u00e4hrwert haben. Um diese Nahrung optimal nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, besitzen die Tiere vor allem im Blinddarm, dem Caecum, symbiotisch lebende Bakterien, welche die Nahrung aufspalten und N\u00e4hrstoffe verf\u00fcgbar machen. \u00c4hnlich wie Kaninchen nehmen Nacktmulle einmal verdaute Nahrung ein zweites Mal auf, um sie noch effizienter zu nutzen (Koprophagie).Mineralien nehmen die Tiere auch \u00fcber die Nahrung sowie durch Knochen auf, die sie bei ihrer grabenden T\u00e4tigkeit finden. Diese Mineralien k\u00f6nnen bei den Tieren durch Vitamin-D3-unabh\u00e4ngige Prozesse genutzt werden, da sich das Vitamin bei den ohne Sonnenlicht lebenden Tieren nicht bildet. LebenserwartungNach Sherman und Jarvis k\u00f6nnen Nacktmulle deutlich \u00e4lter als 15 Jahre werden.

W\u00e4hrend andere Nagetiere meist durch Krebserkrankungen sterben und dies durch eine hohe Reproduktionsrate kompensieren, sind das Genreparatursystem und die Proteinstabilit\u00e4t bei Nacktmullen offenbar erheblich besser ausgebildet.

Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The consensus is two species exist, although a third distinct species was described in 2011: The common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans; its color is grey, with the shade of grey varying among populations; it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin. The Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (T. t. ponticus) lives in the Black Sea. The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa; the back is dark-grey and the belly is lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots. The Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus. The following is sometimes recognized as a subspecies of T. truncatus: The Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. gillii or T. t. gillii) lives in the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead. The two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, but they have been shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.Old scientific data do not distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both species as data deficient on their Red List of endangered species because of this issue.Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose belongs in the genus Stenella, since it is more like the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common bottlenose. Dolphins belong to the suborder Odontocetae, which groups all toothed whale species, the largest of which is the sperm whale. The sister branch of Odontocetae includes all baleen-producing species (Mysticetae), the largest of which is the blue whale. HybridsBottlenose dolphins have been known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid."}, {"description": "InteractionThe species sometimes shows curiosity towards humans in or near water. Occasionally, they rescue injured divers by raising them to the surface. They also do this to help injured members of their own species. In November 2004, a dramatic report of dolphin intervention came from New Zealand. Four lifeguards, swimming 100 m off the coast near Whangarei, were approached by a shark (reportedly a great white shark). Bottlenose dolphins herded the swimmers together and surrounded them for 40 minutes, preventing the shark from attacking, as they slowly swam to shore.In coastal regions, dolphins run the risk of colliding with boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating much controversy. Some animal welfare activists claim the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others counter that the dolphins are properly cared for and enjoy interacting with humans.Eight bottlenose dolphins that lived at the Marine Life Aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi were swept away from their aquarium pool during Hurricane Katrina. They were later rescued in the Gulf of Mexico.Therapies for handicapped children can include interactions with bottlenose dolphins. The military of the United States and Russia train bottlenose dolphins as military dolphins for wartime tasks, such as locating sea mines and detecting enemy divers. The USA's program is the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, located in San Diego.Commercial 'dolphin encounter' enterprises and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film \"the Cove\" documents how dolphins are captured and sold to theses enterprises while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the animals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach.Dolphins and porspoises. Australian Government: Dept. of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Retrieved October 24, 2008In the town of Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins drives fish towards fishermen who stand at the beach in shallow waters. One dolphin then rolls over, after which the fishermen throw out their nets. The dolphins feed on the escaping fish. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa. Cultural influence The popular television show Flipper, created by Ivan Tors, portrayed a bottlenose dolphin in a friendly relationship with two boys, Sandy and Bud. A seagoing Lassie, Flipper understood English and was a hero: \"Go tell Dad we're in trouble, Flipper! Hurry!\" The show's theme song contains the lyric \"no one you see / is smarter than he\". The television show was based on a 1963 film, and was remade as a feature film in 1996, starring Elijah Wood and Paul Hogan, as well as a second series running from 1995 to 2000, starring Jessica Alba.Other television appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, in which a dolphin, Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in Bermuda Triangle, a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as seen on Sesame Street and in a Halloween episode of The Simpsons.Dolphin Tale, directed by Charles Martin Smith, starring Nathan Gamble, Ashley Judd, Harry Connick, Jr., Morgan Freeman, Cozi Zuehlsdorff and Kris Kristofferson, is based on the real-life story of the dolphin Winter, who was rescued from a crab trap in December 2005 and lost her tail, but has learned to swim with a prosthetic one. Dolphin Tale 2, a sequel to the 2011 film, featured another dolphin named Hope and an appearance by Bethany Hamilton. The sequel was released on September 12, 2014.Bottlenose dolphins have appeared in novels. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and one of its sequels, So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish, the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth's impending destruction, but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful acrobatics. Bottlenose dolphins are central to David Brin's series of Uplift Universe novels, particularly Startide Rising, where they are one of the four Earth species (along with chimpanzees, gorillas, and dogs) to have been 'uplifted' to sentience. Bottlenose dolphins are primary characters in Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, especially The Dolphins of Pern. Bottlenose dolphins are incorporated into the science fiction video game series Ecco the Dolphin. Delphineus, a dolphin, is featured in the video game EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus, helping the boy, Adam, to find the sea king Cetus (a sperm whale), as well as assisting in cleaning up the underwater environment where he lives. Dolphins are protagonists of Tui Allen's novel Ripple: A Dolphin Love Story, a fictional account of ancient dolphin culture. Two dolphins appeared in the film Jaws 3-D protecting Kathryn Morgan (portrayed by Bess Armstrong), the marine biologist, from shark attacks.The Miami Dolphins NFL franchise uses the bottlenose dolphin as its mascot and team logo.Factual descriptions of the dolphins date back into antiquity\u00a0\u2013 the writings of Aristotle, Oppian and Pliny the Elder all mention the species. ThreatsBottlenose dolphins are still killed in dolphin drive hunts for their meat or to eliminate competition for fish. Bottlenose dolphins (and several other dolphin species) often travel with tuna, and can get caught in tuna nets, which can kill the dolphins. Boycotts of tuna products led to the concept of \"dolphin-safe\" labeling for fishing methods that avoid endangering dolphins.The man-made chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising the immune system of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS has been reported in bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues in many areas of the globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins. Conservation Bottlenose dolphins are not endangered. Their future is stable because of their abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 150 animals, and is declining by around 6% per year from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident to an increase in warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case.In US waters, hunting and harassing of marine mammals is forbidden in almost all circumstances."}, {"description": "In colder waters, they have more body fat and blood, and are more suited to deeper diving. Typically, 18%\u201320% of their bodyweight is blubber. Most research in this area has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Bottlenose dolphins typically swim at 5 -, but are capable of bursts of up to 29 -. The higher speeds can only be sustained for a short time.Goforth, Harold W., Jr. (1990) \"Ergometry (Exercise Testing) of the Bottlenose Dolphin.\" In The Bottlenose Dolphin, edited by Stephen Leatherwood and Randall R. Reeves, pp. 559\u2013574. San Diego: Academic Press, Inc., ISBN 0-12-440280-1. EcholocationThe dolphin's search for food is aided by a form of sonar known as echolocation: they locate objects by producing sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo grows louder, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well-understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets. EyesightDolphins have sharp eyesight. The eyes are located at the sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or reflecting membrane, at the back of the retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera). SmellBy contrast, a bottlenose's sense of smell is poor, because its blowhole, the analogue to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but this has not been well-studied. Anecdotally, some animals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference. CommunicationBottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds, whistles, and body language. Examples of body language include leaping out of the water, snapping jaws, slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads. Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).Researchers from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI), based in Sardinia (Italy) have now shown whistles and burst pulsed sounds are vital to the animals' social life and mirror their behaviors.The tonal whistle sounds (the most melodious ones) allow dolphins to stay in contact with each other (above all, mothers and offspring), and to coordinate hunting strategies. The burst-pulsed sounds (which are more complex and varied than the whistles) are used \"to avoid physical aggression in situations of high excitement\", such as when they are competing for the same piece of food, for example. The dolphins emit these strident sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. The \"least dominant\" one soon moves away to avoid confrontation.Other communication uses about 30 distinguishable sounds, and although famously proposed by John Lilly in the 1950s, no \"dolphin language\" has been found. However, Herman, Richards, and Wolz demonstrated comprehension of an artificial language by two bottlenose dolphins (named Akeakamai and Phoenix) in the period of skepticism toward animal language following Herbert Terrace's critique."}, {"description": "Respiration and sleepThe bottlenose dolphin has a single blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 ml of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml/kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The bottlenose dolphin typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole two to three times per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.Dolphins can breathe while \"half-asleep\". During the sleeping cycle, one brain hemisphere remains active, while the other hemisphere shuts down. The active hemisphere handles surfacing and breathing behavior. The daily sleeping cycle lasts for about 8 hours, in increments of minutes to hours. During the sleeping cycle, they remain near the surface, swimming slowly or \"logging\", and occasionally closing one eye. Reproduction Both sexes have genital slits on the underside of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one on each side of the genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.During the breeding season, males compete for access to females. Such competition can take the form of fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.Connor R. C. (1990) Alliances among male bottlenose dolphins and comparative analyses of mutualism. PhD Dissertation. The University of Michigan, Michigan.Mating occurs belly to belly. Dolphins have been observed engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young, suggesting they may mate for pleasure. The gestation period averages 12 months. Births can occur at any time of year, although peaks occur in warmer months. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a (possibly male) \"midwife\", and usually only a single calf is born. Twins are possible, but rare. Newborn bottlenose dolphins are 0.8 - long and weigh 9 -, with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants. To accelerate nursing, the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands. The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years, and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning. Females sexually mature at ages 5\u201313, males at ages 9\u201314. Females reproduce every two to six years. Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable, and that early bonds aid protection, as well as in locating females. Social interaction Adult males live mostly alone or in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult female and young dolphins normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs.Wells, R.S., M.D. Scott and A.B. Irvine. (19870 \"The social structure of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins\", pp. 247\u2013305 in: Genoways, H. (ed.), Current Mammalogy, Vol. 1. New York: Plenum Press. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000. The social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins \"provide interesting parallels\" with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees.Bottlenose dolphins studied by Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers off the island of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior does not depend on feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area."}, {"description": "CognitionCognitive abilities that have been investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.A dolphin was shown two panels with varying numbers of dots of different size and position. The dolphin was able to touch the panel with the greater number. Tool use and cultureAt least some wild bottlenose dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably to protect it when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).Mud plume feeding is a feeding technique performed by a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud in the water column and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.Along the beaches and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, bottlenose dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as \"strand feeding\". Groups of between two and six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water. The dolphins follow the fish, stranding themselves briefly, to eat their prey before twisting their bodies back and forth in order to slide back into the water.Some Mauritanian dolphins cooperate with human fishermen. The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture.Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three bottlenose dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they elevate the upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her. Cortical neuronsSome researchers theorize mammalian intelligence correlates to the number of nerve cells (neurons) in the cortex of the brain. Bottlenose dolphins have about 5.8 billion cortical neurons, placing them between chimpanzees at 6.2 billion and gorillas at 4.3 billion. (Humans have 11.5 billion.) However, after Homo sapiens, the species with the highest number of cortical neurons and synapses is the elephant."}, {"description": "Feeding A dolphin's diet consists mainly of small fish, crustaceans, and squid. Although this varies by location, many populations share an appetite for fish from the mullet, the tuna and mackerel, and the drum and croaker families. Its cone-like teeth serve to grasp, but do not chew food. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they work as a team to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called \"fish whacking\". \"Strand feeding\", is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore.Bottlenose dolphins conflict with small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common bottlenose dolphins are probably attracted to fishing nets because they offer a concentrated food source. Relations with other species Dolphins can exhibit altruistic behaviour toward other sea creatures. On Mahia Beach, New Zealand, on March 10, 2008, two pygmy sperm whales, a female and calf, stranded on the beach. Rescuers, including Department of Conservation officer Malcolm Smith, attempted to refloat them four times. Shortly, a playful bottlenose dolphin known to local residents as Moko arrived and, after apparently vocalizing at the whales, led them 200 m along a sandbar to the open sea, saving them from imminent euthanasia.The bottlenose dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank and access to females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, with a series of acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.Dolphin attacks on porpoises baffle experts BBC News, July 15, 2014The bottlenose dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, such as the short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, they can also be hostile. PredatorsSome large shark species, such as the tiger shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the bottlenose dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to battle the predator to death or force it to flee."}, {"description": "Dolphins are grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. This countershading makes them hard to see, both from above and below, when swimming. Adults range in length between 2 and, and in weight between 150 and.American Cetacean Society Fact Sheet\u00a0\u2013 Bottlenose Dolphin Males are, on average, slightly longer and considerably heavier than females. In most parts of the world, the adult's length is about 2.5 m, with weight ranges between 200 and. Their size varies considerably with habitat. Except in the eastern Pacific, dolphins in warmer, shallower waters tend to be smaller than those in cooler, pelagic waters. A survey in the Moray Firth in Scotland, the world's second northernmost dolphin population, recorded an average adult length of just under 4 m compared with a 2.5 m average in a population off the coast of Florida.Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. However, one study of a population off Sarasota, Florida indicated an average lifespan of 20 years or less."}, {"description": "Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open.Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw.The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or \"hind legs\", at the tail, about the size of a human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism."}, {"description": "Bottlenose dolphins, the genus Tursiops, are the most common and well-known members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent molecular studies show the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide.Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10\u201330 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles emitted from the blowhole and sounds emitted through body language, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations,http://www.pnas.org/content/102/25/8939 and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins are popular from aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing.Bottlenose Dolphins have the largest brain to body mass ratio of any mammal on Earth, sharing close ratios with those of Humans and Great Apes, which more than likely attributes to their incredibly high intelligence and emotional intelligence.http://list25.com/25-most-intelligent-animals-on-earth/2/"}]}

The eastern cottontail breeding season begins later with higher latitudes and elevations. Temperature rather than diet has been suggested as a primary factor controlling onset of breeding; many studies correlate severe weather with delays in the onset of breeding. In New England breeding occurs from March to September. In New York the breeding season occurs from February to September, in Connecticut from mid-March to mid-September. In Alabama the breeding season begins in January. In Georgia the breeding season lasts 9 months and in Texas breeding occurs year-round. Populations in western Oregon breed from late January to early September. Mating is promiscuous.The nest is a slanting hole dug in soft soil and lined with vegetation and fur. The average measurements are: length 7.09\u00a0inches (18.03\u00a0cm), width 4.9\u00a0inches (12.57\u00a0cm), and depth 4.71\u00a0inches (11.94\u00a0cm). The average period of gestation is 28 days, ranging from 25 to 35 days. Eastern cottontail young are born with a very fine coat of hair and are blind. Their eyes begin to open by 4 to 7 days. Young begin to move out of the nest for short trips by 12 to 16 days and are completely weaned and independent by 4 to 5 weeks. Litters disperse at about 7 weeks. Females do not stay in the nest with the young but return to the opening of the nest to nurse, usually twice a day.Reproductive maturity occurs at about 2 to 3 months of age. A majority of females first breed the spring following birth; but 10% to 36% of females breed as juveniles (i.e., summer of the year they were born). Males will mate with more than one female. Female rabbits can have 1 to 7 litters of 1 to 12 young, called kits, in a year; however, the average number of litters per year is 3\u20134 and the average number of kits is 5. In the South female eastern cottontails have more litters per year (up to 7) but fewer young per litter.Nowak, Ronald M.; Paradiso, John L. (1983). Walker's mammals of the world. 4th edition. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press In New England female eastern cottontails have three or four litters per year.

Denver, CO: Colorado Department of Game, Fish and Parks"}, {"description": "In Kansas the largest cause of mortality of radiotracked eastern cottontails was predation (43%), followed by research mortalities (19%), and tularemia (18%). A major cause of eastern cottontail mortality is collision with automobiles. In Missouri it was estimated that 10 eastern cottontails are killed annually per mile of road. The peak period of highway mortality is in spring (March through May); roadside vegetation greens up before adjacent fields and is highly attractive to eastern cottontails.Annual adult survival is estimated at 20%. Average longevity is 15 months in the wild; the longest lived wild individual on record was 5 years old. Captive eastern cottontails have lived to at least 9 years of age.Eastern cottontails are hosts to fleas, ticks, lice, cestodes, nematodes, trematodes, gray flesh fly larvae, botfly larvae, tularemia, shopes fibroma, torticollis, and streptothricosis cutaneous.

Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press: 83\u2013123 PredatorsThe Eastern Cottontail has to contend with many predators, both natural and introduced. Due to their often large populations in Eastern North America, they form a major component of several predators' diets. Major predators of eastern cottontail include domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), foxes (Vulpes and Urocyon spp.), coyote (C. latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), domestic cat (Felis catus), weasels (Mustela spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), mink (M. vison), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), barred owl (Strix varia), hawks (principally Buteo spp.), corvids (Corvus spp.), and snakes.Predators that take nestlings include raccoon, badger (Taxidea taxus), skunks (Mephitis and Spilogale spp.), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). In central Missouri eastern cottontails comprised the majority of biomass in the diet of red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) during the nesting season. In Pennsylvania the chief predator of eastern cottontails is the great horned owl.Rue, Leonard Lee, III. 1965. Cottontail. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company In the Southwest cottontails including eastern cottontail comprise 7 to 25% of the diets of northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). In Texas eastern cottontails are preyed on by coyotes more heavily in early spring and in fall than in summer or winter. In southwestern North Dakota cottontails (both eastern and desert cottontail Sylvilagus auduboni) were major prey items in the diets of bobcats.Juvenile eastern cottontails are rare in the diet of short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Trace amounts of eastern cottontail remains have been detected in black bear (Ursus americanus) scat.Hellgren, Eric C.; Vaughan, Michael R.

The largest ranges are occupied by adult males during the breeding season. In southwestern Wisconsin adult male home ranges averaged 6.9 acres (2.8 ha) in spring, increased to 10 acres (4.0 ha) in early summer, and decreased to 3.7 acres (1.5 ha) by late summer.

Eastern cottontails eat vegetation almost exclusively; arthropods have occasionally been found in pellets. Some studies list as many as 70 to 145 plant species in local diets. Food items include bark, twigs, leaves, fruit, buds, flowers, grass seeds, sedge fruits, and rush seeds. There is a preference for small material: branches, twigs, and stems up to 0.25\u00a0inch (0.6\u00a0cm). Leporids including eastern cottontails are coprophagous, producing two types of fecal pellets, one of which is consumed. The redigestion of pellets greatly increases the nutritional value of dietary items.In summer, eastern cottontails consume tender green herbaceous vegetation when it is available. In many areas Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense) and Canada bluegrass (P. compressa) are important dietary components. Other favored species include clovers (Trifolium spp.) and crabgrasses (Digitaria spp.). In Connecticut important summer foods include clovers, alfalfa, timothy (Phleum pratense), bluegrasses (Poa spp.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens), crabgrasses, redtop (Agrostis alba), ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), goldenrods (Solidago spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), chickweed (Stellaria media), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). Eastern cottontails also consume many domestic crops.During the dormant season, or when green vegetation is covered with snow, eastern cottontails consume twigs, buds, and bark of woody vegetation. In Connecticut important winter foods include gray birch (Betula populifolia), red maple, and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra)."}, {"description": "The eastern cottontail is chunky red-brown or gray-brown in appearance with large hind feet, long ears and a short fluffy white tail.

In winter when deciduous plants are bare eastern cottontails forage in less secure cover and travel greater distances. Eastern cottontails probably use woody cover more during the winter, particularly in areas where cover is provided by herbaceous vegetation in summer.

It lives in a variety of habitats, including dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, montane forest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic. In Gombe, the chimpanzee lives in subalpine moorland, open woodland, semideciduous forest, evergreen forest, and grassland with scattered trees. At Bossou, the chimpanzee inhabits multistage secondary deciduous forests, which have grown after shifting cultivation, as well as primary forests and grasslands. At Ta\u00ef, it can be found in the last remaining tropical rainforest in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.Boesch C, Boesch-Achermann H. (2000) The chimpanzees of the Ta\u00ef Forest: behavioral ecology and evolution. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.The chimpanzee has an advanced cognitive map of its home range and can repeatedly find food. The chimpanzee makes a night nest in a tree in a new location every night, with every chimpanzee in a separate nest other than infants or small chimpanzees, which sleep with their mothers. When confronted by a predator, the chimpanzee will react with loud screams and use any object it can against the threat. Leopard predation is apparently a significant cause of mortality in chimpanzees at Ta\u00ef and Lop\u00e9 National Parks.In some cases, the common chimpanzee has been documented killing leopard cubs, an act which primarily seems to be a protective effort. Lions may have also preyed on the chimpanzees at Mahale Mountains National Park, where at least four chimpanzees could have fallen prey to them. Although no other instances of lion predation on chimpanzees have been recorded, the larger group sizes of savanna chimps may have developed as a response to threats from these big cats. Isolated cases of cannibalism have also been documented. Diet and foraging The chimpanzee is an omnivorous frugivore. It prefers fruit above all other food items and will even seek out and eat them when they are not abundant. It will also eat leaves and leaf buds. Seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark and resin, insects and meat make up the rest of its diet. While the common chimpanzee is mostly herbivorous, it does eat honey, soil, insects, birds and their eggs, and small to medium-sized mammals, including other primates.Isabirye-Basuta G. (1989) \"Feeding ecology of chimpanzees in the Kibale Forest, Uganda\", pp. 116\u201327 in: Heltne PG, Marquardt LA (eds.). Understanding chimpanzees. Cambridge, (MS): Harvard University Press, ISBN 0674920910. The western red colobus ranks at the top of preferred mammal prey. Other mammalian prey include red-tailed monkeys, yellow baboons, blue duikers, bushbucks and common warthogs.Boesch C, Uehara S, Ihobe H. (2002) \"Variations in chimpanzee-red colobus interactions\", pp. 221\u201330 in: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF, editors. Behavioral diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521006139.When hunting small monkeys such as the red colobus, the chimpanzee hunts where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular. This allows it to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an arboreal hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. \"Drivers\" serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. \"Blockers\" are stationed at the bottom of the trees and will climb up to block prey that take off an a different direction. \"Chasers\" move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, \"ambushers\" hide and rush out when a monkey nears. While both adults and infants are taken, adult male black-and-white colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps. In Gombe, the chimpanzee also fears adult female colobus monkeys, and prefers to snatch infants from their mother's bellies without harming the mothers. Male chimps hunt more than females. When caught and killed, the meal is distributed to all hunting party members and even bystanders.Despite the fact that common chimpanzees are known to hunt, and to collect insects and other invertebrates, such food actually makes up a small portion of their diet; from as little as two percent yearly to as much as 65 grams of meat per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting seasons. This also varies from troop to troop and year to year. However, in all cases the majority of their diet consists of fruits, leaves, roots and other plant matter.http://www.allaboutwildlife.com/what-do-chimps-eat"}, {"description": "Field studyJane Goodall undertook the first long-term field study of the common chimpanzee, begun in Tanzania at Gombe Stream National Park in 1960. Other long-term study sites begun in 1960 include A. Kortlandt in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Junichiro Itani in Mahale Mountains National Park in Tanzania. Current understanding of the species' typical behaviors and social organization are formed largely from Goodall's ongoing 50-year Gombe research study. Genome Project Human and common chimpanzee DNA are very similar. After the completion of the Human Genome Project, a Chimpanzee Genome Project was initiated. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes, such as the forkhead-box P2 transcription factor which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on September 1, 2005, in an article produced by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium.The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. Typical human and chimp protein homologs differ in only an average of two amino acids. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of chromosomes have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions, during the approximately four to six million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from human and chimp genome analyses, currently being conducted by geneticists including David Reich, should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases. AttacksCommon chimpanzees have been known to attack humans. On infant humansIn Uganda, there have been several attacks on children, some of them fatal. It has been suggested some of these attacks are due to the chimpanzees being intoxicated (from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations) and mistaking human children for the Western red colobus, one of their favorite meals. Human interactions with chimpanzees may be especially dangerous if the chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals. There are at least six documented cases of chimpanzees snatching and eating human babies. On adult humansA chimpanzee's great strength and sharp teeth mean that attacks, even on full-grown men, can cause severe injuries. This was evident after the attack and near death of former NASCAR driver St. James Davis who was mauled by two chimps before they were killed. Another example of chimpanzees being aggressive toward humans occurred in 2009 in Stamford, Connecticut, when a 200 lb, 14-year old pet chimp named Travis attacked his owner's friend, who lost her hands, eyelids, nose and part of her maxilla from the attack. Link with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Two types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world; HIV-2 is largely confined to west Africa. Both types originated in west and central Africa, jumping from primates to humans. HIV-1 has evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) found in the common chimpanzee subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, native to southern Cameroon. Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has the greatest genetic diversity of HIV-1 so far discovered, suggesting the virus has been there longer than anywhere else. HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, found in the sooty mangabey monkeys in Guinea-Bissau. Status and conservationChimpanzee are a legally protected species in most of their range and can be found both in and outside national parks. There are thought to be between 172,700 to 299,700 individuals living in the wild.The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease. Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by deforestation in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations and may allow poachers more access to areas that have not been seriously impacted by humans. While deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may be done outside national parks.Chimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of bushmeat sold in urban markets. They are also taken in pet trades despite it being illegal in many countries where they live. Chimpanzees are also hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Capturing chimpanzees for scientific research is still allowed in some countries, such as Guinea. People will kill any chimpanzee that threatens their crops. Chimps may also be unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans since the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees."}, {"description": "Group structure Common chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time travelling in small, temporary groups consisting of a few individuals, \"which may consist of any combination of age and sex classes.\"Van Lawick-Goodall, Jane (1968). \"The Behaviour of Free-Living Chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve\". Animal Behaviour Monographs (Rutgers University) 1 (3): 167. Both males and females will sometimes travel alone. The common chimpanzee lives in a fission-fusion society and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, consisting of both sexes, or one female and her offspring. Chimpanzees have complex social relationships and spend a large amount of time grooming each other.The Chimpanzees of Tanzania\". Wild Kingdom. December 31, 1976.At the core of social structures are males, which roam around, protect group members, and search for food. Males remain in their natal communities, while females generally emigrate at adolescence. As such, males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other. Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy and males are dominant over females. However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, \"in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest,\" is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within their fission-fusion social groups. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger \"parent\" group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees which regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area). As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized to hunt for meat, while a group consisting of lactating females serves to act as a \"nursery group\" for the young. An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated. Male chimpanzees exist in a linear dominance hierarchy. Top-ranking males tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability.Muller, MN. (2002) \"Agonistic relations among Kanyawara chimpanzees\", pp. 112\u2013124 in: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF, editors. Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521006139. This is likely due to the chimp\u2019s fission-fusion society, with male chimps leaving groups and returning after extended periods of time. With this, a dominant male is unsure if there has been any \"political maneuvering\" and must re-establish his dominance. Thus, a large amount of aggression occurs 5\u201315 minutes after a reunion.Bygott, JD. (1979) \"Agonistic behavior, dominance, and social structure in wild chimpanzees of the Gombe National Park\", pp. 73\u2013121 in: Hamburg, DA, McCown, ER (eds.) The great apes. Menlo Park: Benjamin-Cummings, ISBN 0805336699. During aggressive encounters, displays are preferred over attacks.Males maintain and improve their social ranks by forming coalitions. These coalitions have been characterized as \"exploitive\" and are based on an individual\u2019s influence in agonistic interactions.de Waal, FBM. (1987) \"Dynamic of social relationships\", pp. 421\u2013429 in: Smuts BB, Cheney DL, Seyfarth RM, Wrangham RW, Struhsaker TT (eds.) Primate societies, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0226767167. Being in a coalition allows males to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves, as politically apt chimps can exert power over aggressive interactions regardless of their rank. Coalitions can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant male. The more allies a male has, the better his chance of becoming dominant. However, most changes in hierarchical rank are caused by dyadic interactions. Chimpanzee alliances can be very fickle and one member may turn on another if it serves him.Nishida, T., M. Hiraiwa-Hasegawa. (1986) \"Chimpanzees and Bonobos: Cooperative Relationships among Males\". pp. 165\u2013177 in B.B. Smuts, D.L. Cheyney, R.M. Seyfarth, R.W. Wrangham, T.T. Struhsaker (eds.) Primate Societies. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0226767167.Low ranking males commonly switch sides in disputes between more dominant individuals. Low ranking males benefit from an unstable hierarchy and have increased sexual opportunities. In addition, conflicts between dominant males cause them to focus on each other rather than the lower ranking males. Social hierarchies among adult females tend to be weaker. Nevertheless, the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring. Females in Ta\u00ef have also been recorded to form alliances.Stumpf, R. (2007) \"Chimpanzees and bonobos: Diversity within and between species\", pp. 321\u2013344 in: Campbell CJ, Fuentes A, Mackinnon KC, Pancer M, Bearder SK (eds.) Primates in perspective. New York: Oxford University Press, ISBN 0195390431. Social grooming appears to be important in the formation and maintenance of coalitions. It is more common among adult males than adult females.Chimpanzees have been described as highly territorial and are known to kill other chimps, although Margaret Power wrote in her 1991 book The Egalitarians that the field studies from which the aggressive data came, Gombe and Mahale, use artificial feeding systems that increased aggression in the chimpanzee populations studied, so might not reflect innate characteristics of the species as a whole. In the years following her artificial feeding conditions at Gombe, Jane Goodall described groups of male chimps patrolling the borders of their territory brutally attacking chimps which had split off from the Gombe group. A study published in 2010 found that the chimpanzees wage wars over land, not mates. Patrol parties from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbors. Patrol parties from large groups will even take over a smaller group's territory, gaining access to more resources, food and females.Goodall documented many occasions within Gombe Stream National Park of chimpanzees and western red colobus monkeys ignoring each other within close proximity. Mating and parenting Chimpanzees mate throughout the year, although the number of females in estrus varies seasonally in a group.Wallis J. (2002) \"Seasonal aspects of reproduction and sexual behavior in two chimpanzee populations: a comparison of Gombe (Tanzania) and Budongo (Uganda)\", pp. 181\u201391 in: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF (eds.) Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521006139. Female chimps are more likely to come into estrus when food is readily available. Estrous females exhibit sexual swellings. Chimp mating tends to be promiscuous, with females mating with multiple males in her community during estrus. As such, males have large testicles for sperm competition. However, other forms of mating also exist. A community's dominant males sometimes restrict reproductive access to females. A male and female can form consortship and mate outside their community. In addition, females sometimes leave their communities and mate with males from neighboring communities.These alternative mating strategies give females more mating opportunities without losing the support of the males in their community. Infanticide has been recorded in chimp communities in Gombe, Mahale, and Kibale National Parks. Male chimps practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth intervals in the females. There are also accounts of infanticide by females. There are questions whether cases of female infanticide are related to the dominance hierarchy in females or are simply isolated pathological behaviors.Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers. The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care. Mothers provide their young with food, warmth, and protection, and teach them certain skills. In addition, a chimp\u2019s future rank may be dependent on its mother\u2019s status. For their first 30 days, infants cling to their mother's bellies. Newborn chimps are helpless; their grasping reflex is not strong enough to support them for more than a few seconds. Infants are unable to support their own weight for their first two months and need their mothers' support.Bard KA. (1995) \"Parenting in primates\", pp. 27\u201358 in: Bornstein MH, editor. Handbook of parenting. Volume 2, Biology and ecology of parenting. Mahwah (NJ): L Erlbaum Associates, ISBN 0805837795.When they reach five to six months, infants ride on their mothers\u2019 backs. They remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year. When they reach two years of age, they are able to move and sit independently. By three years, infants will move farther away from their mothers. By four to six years, chimps are weaned and infancy ends.The juvenile period for chimps lasts from their sixth to ninth years. Juveniles remain close to their mothers, but they also have more interactions with other members of their community. Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters. Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting and boundary patrolling. Communication Chimpanzees use a variety of facial expressions, postures and sounds to communicate with each other. Chimps have expressive faces which are important in close-up communications. When frightened, a \"full closed grin\" causes nearby individuals to be fearful, as well. Other facial expressions include the \"lip flip\", \"pout\", \"sneer\", and \"compressed-lips face\". When submitting to a conspecific, a chimp will crunch, bob and extend a hand. When in an aggressive mode, a chimp will swagger bipedally, hunched over and arms waving, in an attempt to exaggerate its size. Chimps will beat their hands and feet against the trunks of large tree, an act known as \"drumming\".Vocalizations are also important in chimp communication. The most common and important call in adults is the \"pant-hoot\". These calls are made when individuals are excited. Pant-hoots are made of four parts, starting with soft \"hoos\" that get louder and louder and climax into screams and sometimes barks; the former die down to soft \"hoos\" again as the call ends. Submissive individuals will make \"pant-grunts\" towards their superiors. Chimps use distance calls to draw attention to danger, food sources or other community members. \"Barks\" may be made as \"short barks\" when hunting and \"tonal barks\" when sighting large snakes. Tool use Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools. They will modify sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them when foraging for honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. Despite the lack of complexity, there does seem to be forethought and skill in making these tools and should be considered such.Boesch C, Boesch H. (1993) \"Diversity of tool use and tool-making in wild chimpanzees\", pp. 158\u201387 in: Berthelet A, Chavaillon J (eds.) The use of tools by human and non-human primates. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, ISBN 0198522630. While it has been known since Jane Goodall's 1960s discovery that modern chimpanzees use tools, research published in 2007 indicates that chimpanzee stone tool use dates to at least 4,300 years ago.A common chimpanzee from the Kasakela chimpanzee community was the first non-human animal observed making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound. At Ta\u00ef, chimps simply use their hands to extract termites. When foraging for honey, chimps will use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive, that is, if the bees are stingless. For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, chimps use longer and thinner sticks to extract the honey. Chimps will also fish for ants using the same tactic.Ant dipping is difficult and some chimps never master it. West African chimps will crack open hard nuts with stones or branches. There seems to be some forethought in his activity as these items are not found together or near a source of nuts. Nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned. Chimps will also use leaves as sponges or spoons to drink water.A recent study revealed the use of such advanced tools as spears, which West African chimpanzees in Senegal sharpen with their teeth, being used to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees. An eastern chimpanzee has been observed using a modified branch as a tool to capture a squirrel."}, {"description": "The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known as the robust chimpanzee, is a species of great ape. Colloquially, the common chimpanzee is often called the chimpanzee (or \"chimp\"), though this term can be used to refer to both species in the genus Pan: the common chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo, formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show both species of chimpanzees are the sister group to the modern human lineage.The common chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is considered more robust than the bonobo, weighing between 40 and and measuring approximately 63 to 94 cm (25 to 37 in) from head to tail. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several more years; it reaches puberty at the age of eight to 10, and its lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.The common chimpanzee lives in groups which range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a male-dominated, strict hierarchy, which means disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees.The common chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range in the forests and savannahs of West and Central Africa. The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease."}]}

An adult river otter can weigh between 5.0 and. The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur.The river otter, a member of the weasel family, is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.North American river otters, like most predators, prey upon the most readily accessible species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as frogs\"otter\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. Retrieved 20 Jan. 2014), turtles, and crayfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals and occasionally birds have been reported as well.The range of the North American river otter has been significantly reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts. River otters are very susceptible to environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population."}, {"description": "River otters are active year-round, and are most active at night and during crepuscular hours. They become much more nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. They may migrate as a result of food shortages or environmental conditions, but they do not migrate annually. MovementOtters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, alternate hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or body and tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, is used for stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface. On land, the river otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the sequence of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding is the result of simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water. North American river otters are highly mobile and have the capacity of traveling up to 42 km in one day. Daily movements of yearling males and females in Idaho averaged 4.7 and in spring, 5.1 and in summer, and 5.0 and in autumn, respectively. Daily movements of family groups averaged 4.7 , in spring, summer, and winter, respectively. Both males and family groups travel drastically less during winter. PlayingRiver otters are renowned for their sense of play. Otter play mostly consists of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. River otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting. However, playful behavior was found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature otters. HuntingPrey is captured with a quick lunge from ambush, or more rarely, after a sustained chase. River otters can remain underwater for nearly 4\u00a0minutes, swim at speeds approaching 11 km/h, dive to depths nearing 20 m, and travel up to 400 m while underwater. Several river otters may even cooperate while fishing. Small fish are eaten at the surface, but larger ones are taken to the shore to be consumed. Live fish are typically eaten from the head.River otters dry themselves and uphold the insulative quality of their fur by frequent rubbing and rolling on grass, bare ground, and logs.A highly active predator, the river otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The vulnerability and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability is influenced by the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.The diet of the river otter can be deduced by analyzing either scat obtained in the field, or gut contents removed from trapped otters. Fish are the primary component of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds, aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks. River otters are not scavengers; they avoid consuming carrion.Otters do not dramatically reduce prey populations in the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.There are reports of photographs of retrieving otters that were used by hunters near Butte, Nebraska. Social structure The North American river otter is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social group is the family, consisting of an adult female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which can be made up of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles. Male otters disperse from such family groups more often than females. When females leave, they tend to move much further away (60 \u2013) than males (up to 30 km), which tend to move shorter distances. Male river otters do not seem to be territorial, and newly dispersing males may join established male groups.Hansen, Heidi, et al. \"Social Networks and the Formation and Maintenance of River Otter Groups.\" Ethology 115.4 (2009): 384-396 On occasion, groups of unrelated juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, use the same dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.6 CommunicationCommunication among North American river otters is accomplished mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands may also be secreted when otters are frightened or angry.River otters can produce a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they sometimes give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard among a group of otters is low-frequency chuckling. Reproduction and life cycleNorth American river otters are polygynous. Females usually do not reproduce until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. Males are sexually mature at two years of age. The number of corpora lutea increases directly with age.River otters typically breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16\u201373 minutes and may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female by the neck with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year,north american river otter. Conservenature.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-09. and true gestation lasts 61\u201363 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10\u201312 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.In early spring, expectant mothers begin to look for a den where they can give birth. The female otters do not dig their own dens; instead, they rely on other animals, such as beavers, to provide suitable environments to raise their offspring. When the mothers have established their domains, they give birth to several kits. Litter size can reach five, but usually ranges from one to three. Each otter pup weighs approximately five ounces. At birth, the river otters are fully furred, blind, and toothless. The claws are well-formed and facial vibrissae (about 5 mm long) are present. The kits open their eyes after 30\u201338 days. The newborns start playing at five to six weeks, and begin consuming solid food at 9\u201310 weeks. Weaning occurs at 12 weeks, and females provide solid food for their progeny until 37\u201338 weeks have transpired. The maximum weight and length of both sexes are attained at three to four years of age.The mothers raise their young without aid from adult males. When the pups are about two months old and their coats grow in, their mother introduces them to the water. Otters are natural swimmers and, with parental supervision, they acquire the skills necessary to swim. The otters may leave the den by eight weeks and are capable of sustaining themselves upon the arrival of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the following spring. Prior to the arrival of the next litter, the otter yearlings venture out in search of their own home ranges."}, {"description": "The Northern American river otter is found throughout North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. River otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested regions of the Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range.However, urbanization and pollution instigated reductions in range area. They are now absent or rare in Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Reintroduction projects have expanded their distribution in recent years, especially in the Midwestern United States. In 2010, the Colorado Department of Wildlife reported the species, reintroduced in the 1980s, was \"thriving\" and recommended its protection status be reconsidered.Colorado Otters May No Longer Need Protection. CBS4denver.com (2010-07-17) In late 2012, a river otter nicknamed Sutro Sam took up residence around the former site of the Sutro Baths in San Francisco, the first river otter sighting in that city in more than half a century.Fimrite, Peter (2013-01-04) S.F.'s only river otter at Sutro Baths. SFGate In Canada, North American river otters occupy all provinces and territories, except for Prince Edward Island.Historical records indicate river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages in the continental United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America\u2019s largest otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on all parts of the Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inlands streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas."}, {"description": "Although commonly called a \"river otter\", the North American river otter is found in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, both freshwater and coastal marine, including lakes, rivers, inland wetlands, coastal shorelines, marshes, and estuaries. It can tolerate a great range of temperature and elevations. A river otter's main requirements are a steady food supply and easy access to a body of water. However, it is sensitive to pollution, and will disappear from tainted areas.Like other otters, the North American river otter lives in a holt, or den, constructed in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred. Population localizationAquatic life ties North American river otters almost exclusively to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated with the number of beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.River otters often reside in beaver ponds. Encounters between otters and beavers are not necessarily hostile. In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids. FishRiver otters consume an extensive assortment of fish species ranging in size from 2 to that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure. River otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.). Other fish an integral part of the river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.Adult river otters are capable of consuming 1 to of fish per day. A study conducted on captive otters revealed they preferred larger fish, ranging from 15 to, more than smaller fish, ranging from 8 to, and they had difficulty catching fish species less than 10 cm or larger than 17 cm. Otters are known to take larger fish on land to eat, whereas smaller fish are consumed in the water. CrustaceansOtters may prefer to feed on crustaceans, especially crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.During the winter and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater tendency to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain. Reptiles and amphibiansAmphibians, where regionally accessible, have been found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).Amphibians and reptiles are more obtainable by the river otter during the spring and summer as a result of breeding activity, appropriate temperatures, and water supply for the prey. BirdsWaterfowl, rails, and some colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility of these species is greatest during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).Although they consume birds, river otters do not feed on bird eggs. InsectsAquatic invertebrates have been recognized as an integral part of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters. MammalsMammals are rarely consumed by river otters, and are not a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it has been reported in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver remains in the scat sampled."}, {"description": "The North American river otter is a stocky animal of 5 to, with short legs, a muscular neck no smaller than the head, and an elongated body that is broadest at the hips. An average adult male weighs about 11.3 kg against the female's average of 8.3 kg. Its body length ranges from 66 to. About one-third of the animal's total length consists of a long, tapered tail. Tail lengths range from 30 to. Large male North American river otters can exceed a weight of 15 kg.Hill, Edward P. River Otters. Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management It differs from the European otter by its longer neck, narrower visage, the smaller space between the ears and its shorter tail.American Natural History, by John Davidson Godman, published by Hogan & Thompson, 1836A broad muzzle is found on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, triangular projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.The fur of the species is short (guard hairs average 23.8 mm), with a density of about 57,800\u00a0hairs/cm2 (373,000\u00a0hairs/in2) in the midback section. The pelage has a high luster and varies from light brown to black. The throat, chin, and lips are grayer than the rest of the body. Fur of senescent river otters may become white-tipped, and rare albinos may occur.Sexual dimorphism exists among the river otters. Males are, on average, 5% larger than females. In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females of the same age. A clinical reduction in size may exist from north to south along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west.North American river otters live an average of 21 years of age in captivity, but they can reach 25 years of age. However, they normally live about 8 to 9 years in the wild, but are capable of living up to 13 years of age. Form and function The river otter is physically well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck is the same diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within a few feet of a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.The right lung of the river otter is larger than the left, having four lobes compared with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea of the river otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river otter is 15.3 cm, or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.Most mustelids, including otters, have specialized teeth, including sharp canines and carnassials that inflict lethal bites to prey. Also, river otters have large molars used for crushing hard objects, such as the shells of molluscs. An adult river otter has a total of 36 teeth. Additional premolars may be present. The dental formula is ."}, {"description": "The North American river otter was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal was identified as a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including North American river otter, northern river otter, common otter and, simply, river otter. Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter.The river otter was first classified in the genus Lutra; Lutra was the early European name. The species name was Lutra canadensis. The species epithet canadensis means \"of Canada\". In a new classification, the species is called Lontra canadensis, where the genus Lontra includes all the New World river otters. Molecular biological techniques have been used to determine when the river otter and the giant otter diverged. These analyses suggest they diverged in the Miocene epoch 23.03 to 5.33\u00a0million years ago (Mya), which is \"much earlier\" than indicated in the fossil record. Fossils of a giant river otter dating back 3.5\u00a0Mya have been found in the US Midwest, however fossils of the modern river otter did not appear in North America until about 1.9\u00a0Mya. The earliest known fossil of Lontra canadensis, found in the US Midwest, is from the Irvingtonian stage (1,800,000 to 300,000 years ago). The oldest fossil record of an Old World river otter comes from the late Pliocene epoch (3.6 to 1.8\u00a0Mya). The New World river otters originated from the Old World river otters after a migration across the Bering Land Bridge, which existed off and on between 1.8\u00a0million and 10,000 years ago. The otters migrated to North America and southwards again across the Panamanian Land Bridge, which formed 3\u00a0Mya.

Aquatic predators include the alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and killer whale (Orcinus orca), none of which commonly coexist with this otter and thus rarely pose a threat. On land or ice, the river otter is considerably more vulnerable. Terrestrial predators include the bobcat (Lynx rufus), mountain lion (Felis concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus) and (in young or small otters) red fox (Vulpes vulpes) . Most river otter mortality is caused by human-related factors, such as trapping, illegal shooting, roadkills, and accidental captures in fish nets or set lines. Accidental deaths may be the result of ice flows or shifting rocks. Starvation may occur due to excessive tooth damage.Threats to otter populations in North America vary regionally. Otter inhabitation is affected by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island.During the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.Oil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if the enforcement of water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys). Conservation statusLontra canadensis is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. They have been virtually eliminated through many parts of their range, especially around heavily populated areas in the midwestern and eastern United States. Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.The North American river otter is considered a species of Least Concern according to the IUCN Redlist, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations in many areas of the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.Habitat degradation and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate high levels of mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position at the top of the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes."}, {"description": "Der Nordamerikanische Fischotter (Lontra canadensis) ist ein Marder aus der Gattung der Neuweltotter.

Die gesamte Tragzeit inklusive Keimruhe betr\u00e4gt 290 bis 380 Tage. Die Populationen im S\u00fcden Floridas scheinen diese verz\u00f6gerte Einnistung des Embryos allerdings nicht zu durchlaufen.Nowak, 1999 (S. 740-741) Ein Wurf besteht aus ein bis f\u00fcnf blinden, zahnlosen Jungen und wird in einer H\u00f6hle in Gew\u00e4ssern\u00e4he zur Welt gebracht. Diese muss allerdings nicht unmittelbar am Wasser liegen. Die Jungen werden mit einem Alter von zw\u00f6lf Wochen abgestillt und sind mit etwa zwei Jahren selbst geschlechtsreif. Die M\u00e4nnchen beteiligen sich nicht an der Aufzucht der Jungen."}, {"description": "Wie alle Otter ist der Nordamerikanische Fischotter ein ausgezeichneter Schwimmer Fische stellen die Hauptnahrungsquelle dar Die Art ern\u00e4hrt sich vorwiegend von Fischen, frisst aber auch Amphibien, Krustentiere, Nager, Weichtiere, kleine Reptilien und V\u00f6gel. Bisweilen werden auch Fr\u00fcchte verzehrt. Unter den Fischen bevorzugt er langsam schwimmende Arten gegen\u00fcber schnell schwimmenden. Die Populationsdichte des Fischotters h\u00e4ngt in der Regel vom vorhandenen Fischreichtum des Lebensraums ab. In tr\u00fcben Gew\u00e4ssern jagt der Nordamerikanische Fischotter, indem er Fische mit seinen Vibrissen erf\u00fchlt. In klaren Gew\u00e4ssern jagt er auf Sicht. Der Fischotter ist ein ausgezeichneter Schwimmer und Taucher, der bis zu vier Minuten unter Wasser bleiben kann und bis zu 11 km/h schnell schwimmt. Gelegentlich jagen diese Otter auch in Gruppen, um Fische in die Enge zu treiben. Der Nordamerikanische Fischotter ist meist nachts oder in der D\u00e4mmerung aktiv. In den Wintermonaten sieht man die Tiere auch h\u00e4ufiger am Tag. Sie halten keinen Winterschlaf und stellen den Fischen auch unter der Eisdecke nach."}, {"description": "Man unterscheidet folgende Unterarten des Nordamerikanischen Fischotters: L. c. canadensis: \u00d6stliches Kanada (Seeprovinzen, Ontario und Qu\u00e9bec) L. c. kodiacensis: Kodiak-Insel und Shuyak-Insel in Alaska L. c. lataxina: \u00d6stliche Vereinigte Staaten L. c. mira: Prince-of-Wales-Insel (Alaska), Vancouver Island L. c. pacifica: Westliches Kanada und Westliche Vereinigte Staaten L. c. periclyzomae: Haida Gwaii L. c. sonora: S\u00fcdwestliche Vereinigte Staaten, Mexiko"}, {"description": "Verbreitungsgebiet des Nordamerikanischer Fischotters Der Nordamerikanische Fischotter bewohnt weite Teile Nordamerikas von Alaska und Kanada im Norden bis Florida und in den S\u00fcdwesten der Vereinigten Staaten.
