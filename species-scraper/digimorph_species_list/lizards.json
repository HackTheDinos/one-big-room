The body of Kaganaias was both long and broad across the chest, but was predominantly flat. Despite being classified as a lizard, Kaganaias has numerous snake-like features. Sexual dimorphism may have been present in the species, but this is uncertain due to the paucity of data.Kaganaias lived in what was a fertile, inland swamp-like region of Japan, possibly a large floodplain which was covered with water for most of the year. The fossil itself was discovered by a construction team preparing to lay down a new tunnel through a fossil cliff in 1997.Kaganaias almost certainly moved through the water using a snake-like swimming motion, using its short hind legs to navigate. Kaganaias probably fed on other small vertebrates or molluscs which have been found in the surrounding area, but this has yet to be confirmed by the results of the examination of the fossil's faecal remains."}]}

In mice, the SC range for this species is 0.45\u00a0mg/kg \u2013 0.80\u00a0mg/kg. The average venom yield per bite is between 169 and 250\u00a0mg. Though it is responsible for many bites, only a small percentage are fatal if proper medical treatment and anti-venom are given. Mortality rate for untreated bite victims can vary from case to case, depending upon the quantity of venom delivered by the individual involved. According to one study, it is approximately 15\u201320%. but in another study, with 1,224 bite cases, the mortality rate was only 6.5%. The Indian cobra is one of the Big four snakes of South Asia (mostly India) which are responsible for the majority of human deaths by snakebite in Asia. Polyvalent serum is available for treating snakebites caused by this species.Snake-bites: a growing, global threat. BBC News (2011-02-22). Retrieved on 2013-01-03. Zedoary, a local spice with a reputation for being effective against snakebite, has shown promise in experiments testing its activity against cobra venom.The venom of young cobras has been used as a substance of abuse in India, with cases of snake charmers being paid for providing bites from their snakes. Though this practice is now seen as outdated, symptoms of such abuse include loss of consciousness, euphoria, and sedation."}, {"description": "The Indian cobra is classified under the genus Naja of the family Elapidae. The genus was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The species Naja naja was first described by the Swedish physician, zoologist, and botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus Naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors, including morphology, diet, and habitat. Naja naja is part of the subgenus Naja, along with all the other species Asiatic cobras, including Naja kaouthia, Naja siamensis, Naja sputatrix, and the rest. Naja naja is considered to be the prototypical cobra species within the Naja subgenus, and within the entire Naja genus. The below cladogram illustrates the taxonomy and relationships among species of Naja: Taxonomic note The Oriental ratsnake Ptyas mucosus is often mistaken for the cobra; however this snake is much longer and can easily be distinguished by the more prominent ridged appearance of its body. Other snakes that resemble Naja naja are the banded racer Argyrogena fasciolata and the Indian smooth snake Coronella brachyura."}, {"description": "Indian cobras are oviparous and lay their eggs between the months of April and July. The female snake usually lays between 10 to 30 eggs in rat holes or termite mounds and the eggs hatch 48 to 69 days later. The hatchlings measure between 20 and in length. The hatchlings are independent from birth and have fully functional venom glands."}, {"description": "There are numerous myths about cobras in India, including the idea that they mate with ratsnakes.Snake myths. wildlifesos.comRudyard Kipling's short story \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\" features a pair of Indian cobras named Nag and Nagaina, whose names were probably inspired by the species' scientific name, Naja naja. Hinduism The spectacled cobra is greatly respected and feared, and even has its own place in Hindu mythology as a powerful deity. The Hindu god Shiva is often depicted with a cobra coiled around his neck, symbolizing his mastery over \"maya\" or the world-illusion. Vishnu is usually portrayed as reclining on the coiled body of Adishesha, the Preeminent Serpent, a giant snake deity with multiple cobra heads. Cobras are also worshipped during the Hindu festival of Nag Panchami. Snake charmingThe Indian cobra's celebrity comes from its popularity as a snake of choice for snake charmers. The cobra's dramatic threat posture makes for a unique spectacle as it appears to sway to the tune of a snake charmer's flute. Snake charmers with their cobras in a wicker basket are a common sight in many parts of India only during the Nag Panchami festival. The cobra is deaf to the snake charmer's pipe, but follows the visual cue of the moving pipe and it can sense the ground vibrations from the snake charmer's tapping. Sometimes, for the sake of safety, all the venom in cobra's teeth is removed. The snake-charmers sell the venom at a very high price. In the past Indian snake charmers also conducted cobra and mongoose fights. These gory fight shows, in which the snake was usually killed, are now illegal.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. indialawinfo.com"}, {"description": "Colouration and pattern The Indian cobra varies tremendously in colour and pattern throughout its range. The ventral scales or the underside colouration of this species can be grey, yellow, tan, brown, reddish or black. Dorsal scales of the Indian cobra may have a hood mark or colour patterns. The most common visible pattern is a posteriorly convex light band at the level of the 20th to 25th ventrals. Salt-and-pepper speckles, especially in adult specimens, are seen on the dorsal scales. Specimens, particularly those found in Sri Lanka may exhibit poorly defined banding on the dorsum. Ontogenetic colour change is frequently observed in specimens in the north-western parts of their geographic range (southern Pakistan and north-western India). In southern Pakistan, juvenile specimens may be grey in colour and may or may not have a hood mark. Adults on the other hand are typically uniformly black in colour on top (melanistic), while the underside, outside the throat region, is usually light. Patterns on the throat and ventral scales are also variable in this species. The majority of specimens exhibit a light throat area followed by dark banding, which can be 4-7 ventral scales wide. Adult specimens also often exhibit a significant amount of mottling on the throat and on the venter, which makes patterns on this species less clear relative to patterns seen in other species of cobra. With the exception of specimens from the north-west, there is often a pair of lateral spots on the throat where the ventral and dorsal scales meet. The positioning of these spots varies, with nort-western specimens having the spots positioned more anterior, while specimens from elsewhere in their range are more posterior. Many specimens exhibit a hood mark. This hood mark is located at the rear of the Indian cobra's hood. When the hood mark is present, are two circular ocelli patterns connected by a curved line, evoking the image of spectacles. Appearance and sizeThe Indian cobra is a moderately sized, heavy bodied species. This cobra species can easily be identified by its relatively large and quite impressive hood, which it expands when threatened. This species has a head, which is elliptical, depressed, and very slightly distinct from neck. The snout is short and rounded with large nostrils. The eyes are medium in size and the pupils are round. The majority of adult specimens range from 1 to in length. Some specimens, particularly those from Sri Lanka, may grow to lengths of 2.1 to, but this is relatively uncommon. ScalationDorsal scales are smooth and strongly oblique. Midbody scales are in 23 rows (21-25), with 171-197 ventrals. There are 48-75 divided subcaudals and the anal shield is single. There are 7 upper labials (3rd the largest and in contact with nasal anteriorly, 3rd and 4th in contact with eye) and 9-10 lower labials (small angular cuneate scale present between 4th and 5th lower labial), as well as 1 preocular in contact with internasals, and 3 postoculars.

Im Laufe des Wachstums kommt noch eine Verdickung des Schwanzbereiches an der Kloake hinzu. Die F\u00e4rbung beider Geschlechter ist in erster Linie abh\u00e4ngig von der Stimmung und variiert sehr stark. Das Farbspektrum ihrer Chromatophoren umfasst gr\u00fcn, braun, blau, wei\u00df, schwarz, gelb und orange, sowie viele Zwischent\u00f6ne. Die Grundf\u00e4rbung der M\u00e4nnchen wird oft von Gr\u00fcnt\u00f6nen dominiert. Dabei sind meist drei, seltener vier oder f\u00fcnf vertikale, breite, gelbe, h\u00e4ufig d\u00fcnn braun gerandete Streifen auf den Flanken zu sehen. Diese k\u00f6nnen durch horizontale dunklere (braune) Flecken verbunden sein.

Es wurde bereits 1987 von Haikal nachgezogen und ist seitdem in Zucht. Die derzeit in Terrarien verbreiteten Tiere lassen sich keiner nat\u00fcrlich vorkommenden Lokalform oder Unterart mehr zuordnen und sind durch deren Vermischung entstanden.Die Sommertemperatur im f\u00fcr Weibchen wenigsten einen Drittel Kubikmeter gro\u00dfen, f\u00fcr M\u00e4nnchen besser doppelt so gro\u00dfen Terrarium sollte zwischen 26 und 28\u00a0Grad Celsius liegen, wobei nachts eine Temperaturabsenkung auf bis zu 16 und 20 Grad Celsius w\u00fcnschenswert ist, im Winter sind Tags\u00fcber 18 - 20 Grad Celsius und Nachts 12 - 14 Grad Celsius empfehlenswert. Ein au\u00dferhalb des Terrariums angebrachter Spotstrahler ist f\u00fcr die Bildung einer W\u00e4rmezone mit bis zu 40\u00a0Grad Celsius zu empfehlen. In der Winterperiode (zwei bis drei Monate) sind 20 bis 25\u00a0Grad Celsius angebracht; hier reicht es im Regelfall aus, den Spotstrahler nur ein bis zwei Stunden t\u00e4glich zu betreiben. Die t\u00e4gliche Beleuchtungsdauer ist der im nat\u00fcrlichen Habitat des Jemencham\u00e4leons anzupassen und sollte im Sommer 12 bis 13\u00a0Stunden, im Winter 10 bis 11\u00a0Stunden betragen. Ungefiltertes (also nicht durch Glas eintretendes) Sonnenlicht oder spezielle Terrarien-Leuchtstofflampen sollten f\u00fcr ausreichend UV Strahlung sorgen. Eine freie Haltung im Zimmer (auf einer gro\u00dfen Pflanze oder miteinander verbundenen Ampelpflanzen) ist ebenfalls m\u00f6glich, wenn f\u00fcr entsprechende Temperaturen und Beleuchtung gesorgt ist. Der Lebensraum der Cham\u00e4leons sollte t\u00e4glich zweimal bespr\u00fcht werden. Das Futter ist mit Vitaminen (besonders Vitamin D3) und Mineralstoffen (besonders Calcium und Phosphor) anzureichern. Dies gilt insbesondere f\u00fcr im Wachstum befindliche Jungtiere. Den adulten Cham\u00e4leons wird nur alle zwei bis drei Tage tierisches Futter gereicht. Dadurch kann verhindert werden, dass Weibchen zu oft Eier ansetzen oder gar durch die Entwicklung unbefruchteter Eier in Legenot geraten. Weibchen lassen sich in ger\u00e4umigen Terrarien oft gemeinsam halten. Paarweise Haltung gelingt nur selten dauerhaft und ist erst zu versuchen, wenn die Weibchen ein Alter von einem Jahr erreicht haben, um zu fr\u00fche Tr\u00e4chtigkeit zu verhindern. Tr\u00e4chtige Weibchen m\u00fcssen vom M\u00e4nnchen getrennt werden und in ein Terrarium mit mindestens 30\u00a0Zentimeter tiefem, leicht feuchtem Bodengrund \u00fcberf\u00fchrt werden."}, {"description": "Die Art bewohnt ein ausgedehntes und klimatisch heterogenes Verbreitungsgebiet im S\u00fcden der arabischen Halbinsel.

ISBN 3-8001-7248-8 Revierverhalten und Aggressivit\u00e4tWeibchen Die M\u00e4nnchen sind typische Einzelg\u00e4nger, die ihr Revier gegen jedes andere M\u00e4nnchen verteidigen. Bei Auseinandersetzungen zeigen sie eine typische Drohzeichnung. Die Tiere flachen ihre K\u00f6rper ab und bl\u00e4hen den Kehlsack auf. Sie nicken mit dem Kopf, geben bei ge\u00f6ffnetem Maul zischende Laute von sich und rollen die Schw\u00e4nze ein und aus. Der K\u00f6rper schwankt langsam hin und her und offenbart dabei die grellsten Farben. Bringt dieses Imponierverhalten nicht den gew\u00fcnschten Effekt, kann es zu Auseinandersetzungen kommen, in deren Verlauf sich die Tiere ernsthaft verletzen k\u00f6nnen. Dies passiert insbesondere, wenn dem unterlegenen M\u00e4nnchen die R\u00fcckzugsm\u00f6glichkeit fehlt. Schon vier Monate alte M\u00e4nnchen verhalten sich untereinander aggressiv. Weibchen sind untereinander vertr\u00e4glicher. Ern\u00e4hrungWie alle Cham\u00e4leons sind Jemencham\u00e4leons in erste Linie Kleintierfresser. Dabei werden vor allem die unterschiedlichsten Insekten in bekannter Cham\u00e4leonmanier mit der Zunge \u201egeschossen\u201c. Allerdings werden auch Wirbeltiere bis zur Gr\u00f6\u00dfe halbw\u00fcchsiger M\u00e4use nicht verschm\u00e4ht. Neben der tierischen Kost wird pflanzliche Nahrung aufgenommen, besonders in Form sukkulenter Bl\u00e4tter, wie der verschiedener Kalanchoe-Arten. Diese pflanzliche Nahrung dient unter anderem zur Erg\u00e4nzung des Wasserhaushalts, wobei auch Wasser, so in den meist steppenartigen Habitaten vorhanden, getrunken wird. Meist wird es als Tau von Bl\u00e4ttern abgeleckt. In den ersten Monaten ben\u00f6tigen Jemencham\u00e4leons besonders viel Nahrung, da sie in diesem Zeitraum extrem schnell wachsen. So k\u00f6nnen vier Monate alte M\u00e4nnchen in Einzelf\u00e4llen schon auf 30\u00a0Zentimeter L\u00e4nge herangewachsen sein. FortpflanzungTrifft ein M\u00e4nnchen auf ein Weibchen, plattet es seinen K\u00f6rper maximal ab, schaukelt hin und her, rollt den Schwanz rhythmisch auf und ab und zeigt dabei ein pr\u00e4chtiges Balzkleid. Ist das Weibchen nicht zur Paarung bereit, f\u00e4rbt es sich intensiv dunkel und droht dem M\u00e4nnchen mit offenem Maul. Zieht sich dieses daraufhin nicht zur\u00fcck, kann es vom Weibchen ernsthaft verletzt werden, wobei es sich selbst nicht verteidigt, da es durch eine Art Bei\u00dfhemmung blockiert ist. In der Natur ist das Weibchen einmal im Jahr paarungsbereit. Dies ist dann an einer t\u00fcrkisblauen F\u00e4rbung im oberen R\u00fcckenbereich zu erkennen. Das balzende M\u00e4nnchen \u00fcberholt das nur langsam fl\u00fcchtende, paarungsbereite Weibchen und versetzt diesem heftige St\u00f6\u00dfe in die Flanke. Die sich mehrmals t\u00e4glich wiederholenden Paarungen dauern zwischen 10 und 30 Minuten und finden in einem Zeitraum von meist drei bis vier Tagen, in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen auch zwei Wochen, statt.tr\u00e4chtiges Weibchen Die sich anschlie\u00dfende Tr\u00e4chtigkeit wird vom Weibchen durch gelbe und t\u00fcrkisblaue Flecken auf einer dunkelgr\u00fcnen, fast schwarzen Grundfarbe angezeigt. Nach einer durchschnittlichen Dauer von 20 bis 30\u00a0Tagen, in Ausnahmen bis zu 50\u00a0Tagen, gr\u00e4bt das Weibchen eine tunnelf\u00f6rmige H\u00f6hle, an deren Ende die im Schnitt 30 bis 40 (maximal bis zu 100), etwa 15\u00a0Millimeter langen und 10\u00a0Millimeter breiten Eier abgelegt werden. Danach wird diese H\u00f6hle verschlossen. Je nach Temperatur (20 bis 30\u00a0Grad Celsius) schl\u00fcpfen die 55 bis 75\u00a0Millimeter langen Jungtiere nach f\u00fcnf bis neun Monaten. Bei konstant 28\u00a0Grad Celsius schl\u00fcpfen nach etwa sechs Monaten M\u00e4nnchen und Weibchen, w\u00e4hrend bei einer Inkubationstemperatur von st\u00e4ndig \u00fcber 30\u00a0Grad Celsius fast nur M\u00e4nnchen schl\u00fcpfen. Hier liegt offensichtlich eine temperaturabh\u00e4ngige Geschlechtsausbildung (TAGA) vor. Au\u00dferdem scheinen die Jungtiere ihren Schlupf zu koordinieren beziehungsweise zu synchronisieren, da meist alle Tiere eines Geleges am selben Tag schl\u00fcpfen. Geteilte, aber unter gleichen Bedingungen inkubierte Gelege schl\u00fcpfen oft an v\u00f6llig unterschiedlichen Tagen.G\u00fcnter Masurat: Vermehrung von Cham\u00e4leons.

(1800). Essai d'une classification naturelle des reptiles. Bull. Soc. Philomath. 2 (36): 89\u201391 The generic name, Brachylophus, is derived from two Greek words: brachys (\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2) meaning \"short\" and lophos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"crest\" or \"plume\", denoting the short spiny crests along the back of this species. The specific name, fasciatus, is a Latin word meaning \"banded\".This species is closely related to the Fiji crested iguana and B. bulabula. The genus Brachylophus has been suggested to have descended from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene. However, no other members of the putative lineage, living or fossil, have been found outside Fiji and Tonga. An alternative theory is that the ancestors of these iguanas rafted 9000\u00a0km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found."}, {"description": "Courtship is similar to other iguanids, with males approaching and tongue flicking the female's back, forelimbs and nuchal regions after a series of rapid head bobs. The breeding season occurs during the month of November. The Fiji banded iguana is oviparous and has a long incubation period of 160\u2013170 days. Females guard the nest of three to six eggs, which is unusual for iguanids. Hatchlings emerge from their eggs in the rainy season and obtain moisture by licking wet leaves."}, {"description": "FolkloreThe Fijian name for iguana is \"vokai\", although some tribes call it \"saumuri\". Two tribes regard the iguana as their totem and as such its name is not allowed to be mentioned in the presence of women or the offender may be beaten with a stick. The majority of Fijians, however, are terrified of iguanas because of their behavior when threatened. On such occasions, an iguana turns black, opens its mouth and lunges at attackers. ThreatsThe biggest threats this iguana faces is habitat loss due to fires, storms, agricultural development, and competition from feral goats. A secondary threat is introduced predators in the forms of rats, mongoose, and cats which prey on the iguanas and their eggs. Additionally the iguana has been hunted as a food source and for the illegal exotic animal trade. CaptivitySince 1982 the Fijian government has maintained that the entire zoo population of Fiji banded iguanas was obtained illegally or descended from smuggled animals: \"Virtually all of the estimated 50\u2013100 banded iguanas in American zoos have been obtained without the knowledge or consent of the Government of Fiji\". The husbandry of Fiji banded iguanas at the San Diego Zoo has been documented as the most successful breeding colony of Fiji banded iguanas in the world."}, {"description": "The Fiji banded iguana is endemic to the Fiji Islands and is found on the islands of Wakaya, Moturiki, Beqa, Vatulele, Ono, Dravuni, Taveuni, Nggamea, Vanua, Balavu, Avea, Vatu Vara, Lakeba, Aiwa, Oneata, Vanua Levu, Totoya, Kabara, and Fulaga. It was introduced to the Tonga Islands, New Hebrides, and Wallis and Futuna 300 years ago. It has been introduced to Vanuatu as a feral animal in the 1960s. The current wild population is less than 10,000 individuals in 29 distinct subpopulations.

Internally, their right lung is reduced in size to fit their narrow bodies, whereas in snakes, it is always the left lung. Their skeletal structure and skin are also different from those of other squamates. Both genetic and recent fossil evidence indicate that amphisbaenians lost their legs independently from snakes.Muller, J et al. (2011). \"Eocene lizard from Germany reveals amphisbaenian origins.\" Nature 473: 364\u2013367.The head is stout, not set off from the neck, and either rounded, sloped, or sloped with a ridge down the middle. Most of the skull is solid bone, with a distinctive single median tooth in the upper jaw. It has no outer ears, and the eyes are deeply recessed and covered with skin and scales. These rudimentary eyes have a cornea, lens, and complex ciliary body which allows them to detect light but they are reduced in size and do not have an anterior chamber.Foureaux, G., Egami, M.I., Jared, C., Antoniazzi, M.M., Gutierre, R.C., Smith, R.L., 2010. Rudimentary eyes of squamate fossorial reptiles (amphisbaenia and serpentes). John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ. 293(2): 351-7. The body is elongated, and the tail truncates in a manner that vaguely resembles the head. Their name is derived from Amphisbaena, a mythical serpent with a head at each end. The four species of Bipes are unusual in having a pair of forelimbs, but all limbless species have some remnants of the pelvic and pectoral girdles embedded within the body musculature.The skin of amphisbaenians is only loosely attached to the body, and they move using an accordion-like motion, in which the skin moves and the body seemingly just drags along behind it. Uniquely, they are also able to perform this motion in reverse just as effectively.Amphisbaenians are carnivorous, able to tear chunks out of larger prey with their powerful, interlocking teeth. Like lizards, some species are able to shed their tails (autotomy). Most species lay eggs, although at least some are known to be viviparous.The white worm lizard (Amphisbaena alba) is often found in association with leafcutter ants. This reptile is thought to forage in the ants' deep galleries where the insects deposit their waste. The larvae of certain large beetles live in these galleries and it is these on which the reptile preys.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press."}, {"description": "Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by long bodies, reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species possess a pink body coloration and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. All are limbless except for Bipes, which retains forelimbs. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than 6 in long.

Better control of the munitions-sparked wildlifes may have been a reason. In March 2014, The US Fish and Wildlife Service removed the species from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife.

Traditionally, Thai villagers lived in two-story houses; the top floor was for living, while the ground floor was designed to be a space for domestic animals such as pigs, chickens, and dogs. Water monitors would enter the ground floor and eat or maim the domestic animals, also hence the other name dtua gin gai ( \u2018chicken eater\u2019).In Indonesian and Malay, the water monitor is called biawak air,Journal of Bioscience, Volumes 15-16 Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2004 to differentiate it from the biawak pasir (\"sand lizard\"), Leiolepis belliana.The Hope Reports, Volume 4 private circulation, 1903"}, {"description": "The water monitor is a large species of monitor lizard.

Die lichtscheuen Tiere verbringen die meiste Zeit in unterirdischen G\u00e4ngen bzw. H\u00f6hlen, unter Pflanzen oder im Wasser und sind wohl nachtaktiv. Sie sind zumeist sehr lethargisch und bewegen sich selten; in Gefangenschaft lagen viele Taubwarane tagelang an derselben Stelle, meist im Wasser oder in den Bodengrund eingegraben. Die Vorzugstemperatur bei in Gefangenschaft gehaltenen Tieren liegt bei 24 bis 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Weitere Anpassungen an das aquatile Leben sind wohl die weit nach hinten verschobenen Nasenl\u00f6cher (bessere Atmung beim Schwimmen) und das durchsichtige untere Augenlid.

Diese systematische Stellung wurde durch eine im Jahr 2001 ver\u00f6ffentlichte Untersuchung der mitochondrialen DNA best\u00e4tigt. Demnach war die Monophylie der \u00dcberfamilie Varanoidea (Familien Helodermatidae, Lanthanotidae und Varanidae mit jeweils nur einer Gattung) gut begr\u00fcndet; Lanthanotus wurde als Schwestertaxon der Echten Warane (Gattung Varanus) identifiziert.Jennifer C.

Die Helodermatidae geh\u00f6ren demnach nicht in diese Gruppe, stattdessen wurde die Chinesische Krokodilschwanzechse (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) dem Taxon Varanoidea zugeordnet.

Zwar ist der Taubwaran h\u00f6chstwahrscheinlich keines der so genannten \u201emissing links\u201c, doch viele Autoren gehen davon aus, dass sich Schlangen aus taubwaran\u00e4hnlichen Reptilien entwickelten, die in der Kreidezeit existierten. Tats\u00e4chlich zeigt er viele schlangen\u00e4hnliche Merkmale, etwa fast vollst\u00e4ndige Geh\u00f6rlosigkeit. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind die Augen nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig leistungsf\u00e4hig, und die Wirbelzahl ist stark erh\u00f6ht. Merkmale einer \u00dcbergangsform w\u00e4ren im Fall des Borneo-Taubwaranes auch k\u00fcrzere Gliedma\u00dfen und ein verl\u00e4ngerter Rumpf.Von Lanthanotus borneensis selbst ist kein Fossil bekannt. Das einzige bekannte Fossil eines taubwaran\u00e4hnlichen Reptils ist Cherminotus longifrons. Es wurde 1984 von M.

The tail is simply extended skin, spread wide like a fin, and unsupported by any projection. The stomach is comparatively wide. Massing together near the shore, they breed between narrow cracks in the reef and in caves. It is a nocturnal snake, rarely seen during the day. It requires oxygen to breathe, so breaks the surface at least once every six hours.It is too slow to catch fish in a straight chase, so it hunts for fish hiding in the coral. The bite is highly venomous and paralyzes the prey. Females lay their eggs on land.Generally, the species is found in Fiji, southern Japan and Singapore. Their venom is ten times stronger than that of a cobra, making them extremely dangerous.

When it is threatened or captured, it squirts blood from its eye. This blood may have a taste used to deter predators. If the camouflage and intimidation does not work, that is when they squirt out blood aiming for the predators mouth and eyes. This stream can range up to 4 feet and may be repeated several times.

P. mcallii has also been given special status in both California and Arizona, which prevents their collection.Experiments have been conducted to investigate the \"fluctuations in populations of flat-tailed horned lizards, Phrynosoma mcallii, in the Coachella Valley, California. This species has the smallest range of any horned lizard in the United States. In parts of its range, there are potentially conflicting activities, such as suburban development, agriculture, off-road recreation, and activities along the international border.\"\"Between 1978 and 1980 the Bureau of Land Management supported investigations of the status of P. mcallii in California. The purpose of this work was to determine the local distribution and relative abundance of P. mcallii, to correlate these parameters with various habitat attributes, and to gather information on the structure of the populations and mobility and food habits of individual lizards.\"The study also looked at the flat-tailed horned lizard's distribution and abundance throughout Arizona. The species was found to be restricted to an area of desert, 650\u2013700\u00a0km2 in size, in the southwestern corner of the state. The species was most abundant in places with the Western whiptail (Cnemidophorus tigris), nests of the black harvester ant (Messor pergandei), galleta grass (Hilaria rigida) and sandy soils."}, {"description": "The flat-tail horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii) is a reptile of the Sonoran desert of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Its multiple adaptations for camouflage help to minimise its shadow. The species is threatened, with a restricted range under pressure from human activities such as agriculture and development, and is specially protected in the United States."}, {"description": "The flat-tail horned lizard has evolved elaborate camouflage measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under the edge of the body.Sherbrooke, 2003. pp.117\u2013121Different populations of the species match their local backgrounds using a combination of colour-creating cells in their back scales. These cells include black melanophores and red chromatophores in an upper layer, scattered over a layer of white reflective iridophores, enabling the flat-tail horned lizard to match the local soil or rock. So for example the Algondones Dunes population of San Luis, Sonora is generally redder than the population on the whiter Thousand Palms dunes of California. In addition, the dark midline helps to disrupt the outline of the lizard, resembling the thin shadows of plant stems in its windswept sand habitat."}, {"description": "The flat-tail horned lizard is named for Colonel George A.

The common name is derived from the rosy or salmon coloration that is common on the belly of rosy boas originating from coastal southern California and Baja Mexico. Most rosy boas do not have this ventral coloration but instead have a series of dark to orange spots on a light-colored background. Almost all rosy boas have at least some trace of three longitudinal stripes, one down the center of the back, and two on the lower sides. The appearance of these stripes varies widely, from extremely straight and having high contrast with the interspaces, to extremely broken with almost no contrast with the interspaces. Stripe colors can be orange, maroon, rust, brown, or black. Interspace colors can be shades of light to dark gray, yellow, or tan."}, {"description": "Rosy boas spend most of their lives concealed beneath rocks and in crevices to escape the elements and natural predators. Granite outcroppings are the most common geologic association inhabited by the rosy boa. Less often they are found in association with volcanic or other rock types. Only in rare places do rosy boas inhabit rockless environments. In areas with few rocks rosy boas will use rodent burrows for concealment. Rosy boas' activity season follows local weather patterns; however, they are generally dormant during the winter, and active during the spring, summer and fall. Like all snakes, they are dependent on external temperatures to promote such normal bodily functions as digestion and gestation. Throughout most of their range the winter is too cold for these functions and the rosy boas go into a dormant state called brumation. The spring is breeding season for Rosy Boas, resulting in their highest rate of activity. Most Rosy Boas are encountered in spring as they leave the security of their rock piles and crevices to seek mates. Another reason rosy boas may be active on the surface of the ground is to find prey or new territory. The surface activity of rosy boas can take place during any hour of the day, but during hot weather they are primarily nocturnal. In the spring, they are often abroad in the afternoon and early evening. In the late spring and summer, this activity period switches from dusk to late into the night. Because most populations of rosy boas live in exceedingly dry habitats, their activity is often highly moisture dependent. During dry periods they remain deep underground to assist in remaining hydrated. Recent rainfall often results in a flurry of surface activity.These snakes forage mainly for small mammals but have occasionally been known to take other prey items such as birds and lizards. Pack rats, baby rabbits, deer mice, and kangaroo rats make up a large portion of their diet. Rosy boas are one of the slowest-moving species of snake in the world. They are unable to pursue prey and must either wait in ambush or stalk their meals. When a meal is within reach, usually a few inches, a rosy boa will strike with surprising speed and accuracy. Prey is secured with tiny rows of needle-sharp teeth, then suffocated through constriction.Rosy boas are extremely docile when encountered by humans. When disturbed they usually roll into a compact ball with the head in the center.Schmidt, K.P. and D.D. Davis. 1941. Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 365 pp. (Lichanura roseofusca, pp. 96\u201398 & Plate 8.) The species is not prone to bite in defense, and when human bites have occurred they have usually been the result of a feeding response with a captive animal. All rosy boa bites are nonvenomous. Their extreme docility and their attractive coloration have made rosy boas very popular with herpetoculturists."}, {"description": "The rosy boa (Lichanura trivirgata) is a snake of the Boidae family, one of only two members of that family native to the United States.

They are nearly black in color, with a series of yellow spots running along their sides from the tips of their snouts to their rear flanks. The spots shift into thin and subtle yellow bands on their tails. There is also yellow coloring on their underbody. Their heads are smooth and snakelike in appearance, while their bodies are covered in rough skin. They have black teeth and a milky white tongue.Like all night lizards, it is viviparous, giving live birth to its young. Yellow-spotted tropical night lizards also include all-female parthenogenetic (asexually reproducing) populations, located towards the southern end of their range in Central America.Yellow-spotted tropical night lizards live in decaying logs in wet climates. The average life span of the Yellow-spotted tropical night lizard is around 10\u201315 years in the wild.Uncommon in the exotic pet trade, yellow spotted night lizards are aggressive and can deliver a very painful bite to anyone who may handle them. Offspring born by parthenogenesis are handle-able if they are acclimated early in life. Young bark lizards can coexist with like-sized species who enjoy a similar warm and humid climate. Adult bark lizards can not be tamed by handling alone, and will damage their nostrum, or nose scale, if kept in a glass enclosure near a high traffic area or not provided with suitable daytime shelter.

(2000). Reptiles and amphibians of Australia (6th ed.). Sydney: Reed New Holland."}, {"description": "Burton\u2019s legless lizard is generally a diurnal feeder as prey is most commonly encountered during the day but it can be active at any time. This is highlighted as its movements tend to be nocturnal to take advantage of benefits such as reduced risks of hyperthermia during hot conditions and reduced risks of predation from diurnal predators like raptors. Another reason for it to move at night is to avoid revealing its ambush position in the day when it has the highest likelihood of encountering an otherwise unsuspecting prey item. In addition, there is geographic variation in movement and feeding patterns which is expected as this species is very widespread and inhabits a variety of different environments. This lizard is a visually oriented predator that strikes based on movement and requires shelter to ambush its prey. Shelter is also required to hide from predators and may be particularly important after feeding as individuals become more sedentary than usual which is thought to be an anti-predator response.Wall, M., & Shine, R. (2008). Post-feeding thermophily in lizards (Lialis burtonis Gray, Pygopodidae): Laboratory studies can provide misleading results. Journal of Thermal Biology, 33(5), 274-279. doi: 10.1016/j.jtherbio.2008.02.005 Alternatively, shelter also plays a key role in lizard thermoregulation. Deep leaf litter for example, is very good shelter as individuals can bury themselves at an appropriate depth to regulate temperature and remain hidden at the same time.Burton\u2019s legless lizard also uses caudal luring as a feeding strategy which is rare in lizards.Murray, B. A., Bradshaw, S. D., & Edward, D. H. (1991). Feeding behaviour and the occurrence of caudal luring in Burton\u2019s pygopodid Lialis burtonis (Sauria: Pygopodidae). Copeia, 1991(2), 509-516. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1446599?uid=3737536&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103124537611 Notably, this behaviour only occurs if its initial ambush attack is unsuccessful in capturing its intended prey. However, this tactic is not exhibited every time that prey escapes as the likelihood of this tactic being used increases with time since an individual\u2019s last meal. Caudal luring can be used to recapture prey in 3 ways as it can be used to lure prey towards it, to distract prey at the moment that it strikes or both.Feeding strategies are a very important behaviour for this species as the lizards it eats can often be large enough to inflict a retaliatory bite that could cause serious harm. This is thought to be the reason that this species will modify its strike precision according to prey size as strikes at large prey will be directed at either the head or neck to prevent them from biting back. Furthermore, Burton\u2019s legless lizard will hold large prey until it is incapacitated before swallowing to prevent harm to itself whereas it swallows small prey that is still struggling as swallowing live prey costs less energy than waiting for it to be incapacitated.This species also has a tendency to vocalise, especially, when it is threatened. Furthermore, if it is seized by a predator it can drop its tail like many other lizards. However, there are substantial costs associated with a lizard losing its tail as it requires time and energy to grow back."}, {"description": "This species feeds almost exclusively on lizards.Wall, M., & Shine, R.

It is usually found in low vegetation or debris on the ground such as leaf litter which has been shown to be important to specimens located in tropical environments. This was demonstrated in an experiment where individuals were given a choice of several thermally comparable environments and there was an overwhelming preference for leaf litter by specimens from the tropics. In areas where leaf litter is not as readily available this species will use grasses, abandoned burrows and other shelter that it can find as habitat."}, {"description": "The specific name, burtonis, is in honor of British army surgeon Edward Burton (1790\u20131867).Beolens, B.; Watkins, M.; Grayson, M.

Eggs are laid under logs or rocks, on the ground, under leaf litter and sometimes in the nests of sugar ants.Clutches can be laid in quick succession with each clutch containing 1 to 3 tough, leathery eggs, although, a clutch size of 2 eggs is by far the most common.Neill, W.

Das wenige Wissen st\u00fctzt sich ausschlie\u00dflich auf einige Beobachtungen speziell an in Terrarien gehaltenen Tieren. Die lichtscheuen Tiere verbringen die meiste Zeit in unterirdischen G\u00e4ngen bzw. H\u00f6hlen, unter Pflanzen oder im Wasser und sind wohl nachtaktiv. Sie sind zumeist sehr lethargisch und bewegen sich selten; in Gefangenschaft lagen viele Taubwarane tagelang an derselben Stelle, meist im Wasser oder in den Bodengrund eingegraben. Die Vorzugstemperatur bei in Gefangenschaft gehaltenen Tieren liegt bei 24 bis 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Weitere Anpassungen an das aquatile Leben sind wohl die weit nach hinten verschobenen Nasenl\u00f6cher (bessere Atmung beim Schwimmen) und das durchsichtige untere Augenlid. Das Augenlid ist zus\u00e4tzlich zu seiner Durchsichtigkeit nicht wasserdurchl\u00e4ssig, hierdurch k\u00f6nnen Taubwarane beim Tauchen sehen. Ern\u00e4hrungVermutungen zufolge frisst der Taubwaran in seinem nat\u00fcrlichen Lebensraum vor allem Fische, bisher konnte dies jedoch aufgrund fehlender Freilandbeobachtungen nicht best\u00e4tigt werden. In Menschenobhut gelangte Taubwarane verweigerten meist entweder jegliche Nahrungsaufnahme oder leckten am Inhalt von Eiern verschiedener Tiere, speziell Schildkr\u00f6ten und V\u00f6geln.

The species was given this status because of fragmented populations, decreasing population size, and decreasing habitat quality and area, covering only 20,000 square km. The greatest threats to the survival of the species in the wild are habitat destruction and trapping for international pet trade. Eagles are the greatest natural predator of X. grandis, but they are not considered a threat to the survival of the species as a whole. Also, warmer temperatures in their habitat have been shown to cause greater mortality rates among the lizards, posing another potential threat to the species. TemperatureHigher temperatures have been associated with higher mortality rates for X. grandis. In the 2003-2004 wet season of Southern Mexico and Guatemala (the habitat regions of the species), the average temperature was 24.3 C. That temperature was in the top 12% of highest recorded temperatures in the past 34 years of record keeping. The mortality rate for yearlings (the youngest age group) increased from 0.1923 to 0.6551 and for adult II (the oldest age group) increased from 0.3956 to 0.5676 for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 wet seasons respectively. If temperatures continue to increase, the survival of the species will be further threatened and currently 50% of wet seasons are warm enough to be considered to be unfavorable for the species. Population and growth ratesAs of 2004, X. grandis had a survival rate of 70.5% and a growth rate of 0.851. Even though the rates may appear to be low, in comparison to other lizard genera and families X. grandis is doing well.

Copeia, 2, 324-335. Its flattened physiology is most likely an adaptation to allow it to squeeze into narrow crevices. Its color ranges from dark grey to dark brown, with lighter bands or blotches. It has a forked tongue, and small, sharp, fang-like teeth.Hall, D. (2007). The Ultimate Guide to Snakes and Reptiles. Regency House Publishing, Kent. Body size On average, the snout-vent length (SVL) of Xenosaurus grandis is 6.8 - 12.9 cm.Smith, G. R., Lemos-Espinal, J. A. & Ballinger, R.E. (1997). Sexual dimorphism in two species of knob-scaled lizards (Genus Xenosaurus) from Mexico. Herpetologica, 53, 200-205. While some species of Xenosaurus do not exhibit sexual dimorphism, Xenosaurus grandis, among other species, is one that does. In Xenosaurus grandis, males and females do not differ significantly in body size, but males have proportionately larger heads (in length and width) than females. Males and females of X. grandis do not exhibit a significant difference in femur length or head shape. Body temperatureXenosaurus grandis is a diurnally active thermal conformer, meaning that its body temperature correlates with substrate and air temperatures. Its average body temperature is 22.7 C.Ballinger, R. E., Lemos-Espinal, J., Sanoja-Sarabia, S. & Coady, N. R. (1995). Ecological observations of the lizard, Xenosaurus grandis in Cuautlapan, Veracruz, Mexico. Biotropica, 27, 128-132. Air and substrate temperatures may be particularly relevant in Xenosaurus grandis since they are almost exclusively ground and crevice dwellers. Temperatures seem to differ across Xenosaurus species, possibly because of environment and habitat. Xenosaurus grandis appears to inhabit more dense tropical forests, where sunlight may not reach the ground as much.Lemos-Espinal, J. A., Smith, G. R. & Ballinger, R. E. (2003). Ecology of Xenosaurus grandis agrenon, a knob-scaled lizard from Oaxaca, M\u00e9xico. Journal of Herpetology, 37, 192-196. While body temperature is influenced by the lizard\u2019s amount of cover and its body position in its crevice, it does not seem to be influenced by sex, month, vegetation type, or any crevice characteristics. DietLizards in the Xenosaurus genus are exclusively found in crevices. Such a lifestyle suggests that the diets of these lizards might be opportunistic, and they eat whatever crawls or flies past or into their crevice. Lemos-Espinal, J. A. Smith, G. R., & Ballinger, R. E. (2003). Diets of three species of knob-scaled lizards (genus Xenosaurus) from Mexico. Southwestern Naturalist, 48, 119-122. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but occasional lizard prey are taken. Their most frequent prey includes coleopterans (beetles), dipterans (flies), orthopterans (insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, weta, and locusts), and myriapods (terrestrial arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes). On the basis of number, they consume the most dipterans, but on the basis of volume, they consume the most orthopterans."}, {"description": "Xenosaurus grandis and the rest of the xenosaurids are viviparous, which means offspring are birthed live rather than in eggs. Young are birthed after a 9-month gestation period. The majority of litters contain only three offspring, but litters ranging from two to seven offspring have also been observed. Male knob-scaled lizards reach maturity at 28 months, while females reach maturity a little later, at 32 months.Z\u00fa\u00f1iga-Vega, J. J., Rojas-Gonz\u00e1lez, R. I, Lemos-Espinal, J.

The seasonal period of activity is therefore considerably shorter in the north.

Major differences between this species and the checkered whiptail (Aspidoscelis tesselata) include the lack of enlarged scales anterior to the gular fold and the presence of enlarged antebatrachial scales.

The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana ranged over most of North America. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizard appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicates that the beaded lizard is better placed in a separate family.The species was first described in 1829 by Arend Wiegmann as Trachyderma horridum, however, he renamed it Heloderma horridum six months later. Its generic name Heloderma means \"studded skin\", from the Ancient Greek words h\u00ealos (\u1f27\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2)\u2014the head of a nail or stud\u2014and d\u00e9rma (\u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1), meaning skin. Its specific name, horr\u012ddum, is the Latin word meaning rough or rude.There are four subspecies of beaded lizard, elevated to full species in 2013:http://www.redlist-arc.org/Article-PDFs/Special%20Mexico%20Issue_ARC_7(1)_74-96_low_res.pdf Reiserer & al., 2013, Taxonomic reassessment and conservation status of the beaded lizard, Heloderma horridum (Squamata: Helodermatidae) Mexican beaded lizard (H. horridum) (Wiegmann, 1829) Chiapan beaded lizard (H. alvarezi) Bogert and Martin del Campo, 1956 Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (H. exasperatum) Bogert and Martin del Campo, 1956 Guatemalan beaded lizard (H. charlesbogerti) Campbell and Vannini, 1988"}, {"description": "The beaded lizard is found in the Pacific drainages from southern Sonora to south-western Guatemala and two Atlantic drainages, from central Chiapas to south-eastern Guatemala. Their habitats are primarily tropical deciduous forests and thorn scrub forests, but are found in pine-oak forests, with elevations from sea level to 1500 metres. In the wild, the lizards are only active from April to mid-November, spending about an hour per day above the ground.The nominate subspecies H. h. horridum is found in Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (H. h. exasperatum) is found from southern Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The black beaded lizard (H. h. alvarezi) is found in the northern Chiapas and the depression of the R\u00edo Lagartero in Huehuetenango to north-western Guatemala. The ranges of these three subspecies overlap, making them sympatric. The Motagua Valley subspecies (H. h. charlesbogerti) is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (H. h. alvarezi) by 250 kilometres of unsuitable habitat. The Motagua Valley beaded lizard is the most endangered of the subspecies if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the R\u00edo Motagua in north-eastern Guatemala; less than two hundred are believed to exist in the wild."}, {"description": "Diet The beaded lizard is a specialized vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs. A semiarboreal species, it is found climbing deciduous trees in search of prey when encountered above ground. It will occasionally prey upon small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, and insects. Steve Angeli and Robert Applegate, noted captive breeders of the beaded lizard, have remarked that captive specimens, do best on a diet of small vertebrates primarily Mice and Rats. Problem Feeders or confiscated wild caught specimens can be made to feed by using egg on the prey item. VenomThe venom glands of the beaded lizard are modified salivary glands located in the reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading to the base of its grooved teeth. When biting, the beaded lizard hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The beaded lizard's venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.While invertebrates are essentially immune to the effects of this venom, effects on vertebrates are more severe and varied. In mammals such as rats, major effects include a rapid reduction in carotid blood flow followed by a marked fall in blood pressure, respiratory irregularities, tachycardia, and other cardiac anomalies, as well as hypothermia, edema, and internal hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, eyes, liver, and kidneys. In humans, the effects of bites are associated with excruciating pain that may extend well beyond the area bitten and persist up to twenty-four hours. Other common effects of bites on humans include local edema (swelling), weakness, sweating, and a rapid fall in blood pressure. Beaded lizards are immune to the effects of their own venom.The compounds in its saliva which have been studied have pharmacological properties relating to diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and even HIV. This hormone was named exendin-3 and is marketed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals as the drug exenatide. One study reported in 1996 revealed that it binds to cell receptors from breast cancer cells and may stop the growth of lung cancer cells. ReproductionThe beaded lizard becomes sexually mature at six to eight years and mates between September and October. Males engage in ritual combat that often lasts several hours; the victor mates with the female. The female lays her clutch of two to 30\u00a0eggs between October and December, the clutch hatching the following June or July.Young lizards are seldom seen. They are believed to spend much of their early lives underground, emerging at two to three years of age after gaining considerable size."}, {"description": "Adult beaded lizards range from twenty-four to thirty-six inches (sixty-one to ninety-one centimetres) in length. It is substantially larger than the Gila monster, which only reaches lengths of twelve to sixteen inches (thirty to forty-one centimetres). Although males are slightly larger than females, the lizards are not sexually dimorphic. Both males and females are stocky with broad heads, although the males tend to be broader. The beaded lizard's scales are small, beadlike, and not overlapping. Except for the lizard's underside, the majority of its scales are underlaid with bony osteoderms.Their base color is black and marked with varying amounts of yellow spots or bands, with the exception of H. h. alvarezi, which tends to be all black in color. The beaded lizard has a short tail which is used to store fat so it can survive during months of estivation. Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and can not grow back if broken. The beaded lizard has a forked, black tongue which it uses to smell, with the help of a Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.Cogger (1992) p. 156"}, {"description": "The beaded lizard is surrounded by myth and superstition in much of its native range. It is incorrectly believed, for example, that the lizard is more venomous than a rattlesnake, that it can cause lightning strikes with its tail, or make a pregnant woman miscarry by merely looking at it. As a result of this superstition, locals often kill the lizard on sight.The seldom-seen lizard is poached for resale through the illegal exotic beast trade. It does not reproduce well in captivity, and its scarcity means a high price for collectors. As a direct result, the beaded lizard is protected by Mexican law under the category A (Threatened), and it dwells within the range of several protected areas. In Guatemala, it is protected by national legislation, and part of its range is within protected areas. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.Fewer than 200 lizards remain in the dry forest habitat of the Motagua Valley, and this subspecies of beaded lizard (H. h. charlesbogerti) was facing extinction due to local extermination and loss of habitat for agricultural purposes. A conservation effort has been launched known as Project Heloderma to preserve the semiarid habitat of the Motagua Valley by the Nature Conservancy and partners such as ZOOTROPIC, CONAP, the International Reptile Conservation Foundation, Lincoln Park Zoo, Zoo Atlanta, and the San Diego Zoo. This effort has been successful in getting the Guatemalan government to list the beaded lizard under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as an Appendix I animal, making it illegal to export the species."}, {"description": "The beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) is a species of venomous lizard found principally in Mexico and southern Guatemala. It and its congener the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The beaded lizard is larger than the Gila monster but has duller coloration, black with yellowish bands of differing width depending on the subspecies. As it is a specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacting drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is on-going.Threatened throughout its range by overcollection and habitat loss, it is a CITES protected species. The Motagua Valley subspecies (H. h. charlesborgeti) is one of the rarest lizards in the world, with a wild population of fewer than two hundred."}]}

When young, they are equally at home on the ground and in trees, but as they gain girth they tend to restrict most of their movements to the ground. They are also excellent swimmers, being able to stay submerged for up to half an hour. Burmese pythons spend the majority of their time hidden in the underbrush. In the northern parts of its range, the Indian python may brumate for some months during the cold season in a hollow tree, a hole in the riverbank or under rocks. BrumationGlossary of commonly used terms is biologically distinct from hibernation. While the behaviour has similar benefits, specifically to endure the winter without moving, it also involves preparation of both male and female reproductive organs for the upcoming breeding season. There is controversy over whether the Burmese species is able to brumate.Burmese pythons breed in the early spring, with females laying clutches which average 12\u201336 eggs in March or April. She will remain with the eggs until they hatch, wrapping around them and twitching her muscles in such a way as to raise the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings use their egg tooth to cut their way out of their eggs, there is no further maternal care. The newly hatched will often remain inside their egg until they are ready to complete their first shedding of skin, after which they hunt for their first meal."}, {"description": "Burmese pythons are often sold as pets, and are made popular by their attractive colour and apparently easy-going nature.

By age 4, they will have reached their adult size, though they continue growing very slowly throughout their lives, which may exceed 20 years.Although this species has a reputation for docility, they are very powerful animals, capable of inflicting severe bites or even killing a keeper by constriction.Thirteen Foot Burmese Python Kills Owner They also consume large amounts of food, and due to their size, require large, often custom-built, secure enclosures, which can be very expensive. As a result some are released to the wild by irresponsible pet owners. For this reason, some jurisdictions (including Florida) have placed restrictions on the keeping of Burmese pythons as pets. Violators would be imprisoned for more than 7 years or fined $500,000 if convicted.A secondary problem with feeding Burmese pythons is that many owners believe if a snake acts hungry, that it should be fed. As Burmese pythons are opportunistic feeders, they will eat almost any time food is offered, and often act hungry even when they have recently eaten. This often leads to overfeeding, and obesity-related problems are common in captive Burmese pythons. HandlingAlthough pythons are typically afraid of people due to their high stature, and will generally avoid humans, special care is still required when handling them.

Variations The Burmese python is frequently captive-bred for colour, pattern, and more recently size. Its albino form is especially popular and is the most widely available morph. They are white with patterns in butterscotch yellow and burnt orange. There are also \"labyrinth\" specimens, which have mazelike patterns; khaki-coloured \"green\"; and \"granite\", which have many small angular spots. Breeders have recently begun working with an island lineage of Burmese pythons. Early reports indicate that these \"dwarf\" Burmese have slightly different colouring and pattern from their mainland relatives and do not grow much over 2.1 m in length. One of the most sought-after of these variations is the leucistic Burmese. This particular variety is very rare, being entirely bright white with no pattern and blue eyes, and has only recently (2008/2009) been reproduced in captivity as the homozygous form (referred to as \"super\" by reptile keepers) of the codominant hypomelanistic trait.

Their diet consists primarily of appropriately sized birds and mammals. The snake uses its sharp rearward-pointing teeth to seize its prey, then wraps its body around the prey, at the same time contracting its muscles, killing the prey by constriction. They are often found near human habitation due to the presence of rats, mice and other vermin as a food source. However, their equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means that they are often treated as pests. In captivity their diet consists primarily of commercially available, appropriately sized rats, graduating to larger prey such as rabbits and poultry as they grow. Exceptionally large pythons may even require larger food items such as pigs or goats, and are known to have attacked and eaten alligators and adult deer in Florida, where they are an invasive species.National Geographic: Python Bursts After Eating Gator DigestionThe digestive response of Burmese pythons to such large prey has made them a model species for digestive physiology. A fasting python will have a reduced stomach volume and acidity, reduced intestinal mass and a 'normal' heart volume.

It has been suggested that the current number of Burmese pythons in the Florida everglades has reached a minimum viable population and become an invasive species. More than 1,330 (US National Park Service website - December 31, 2009http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/burmesepython.htm) have been captured in the Everglades.A paper published by the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggested that bird and coyote populations are threatened, as well as already-rare rival predatory species, such as Florida panthers.Florida's Hurricane Andrew was deemed responsible for the destruction of a python breeding facility as well as with possible zoo, warehouse, and household escapees.By 2007, the Burmese python was already established in Northern Florida, in the coastal areas of the Florida Panhandle (see map). In February 2008, USGS scientists published a projected range map for the US, based on average climate data of the snake's home range and global warming projections, which predicted that by the end of the 21st century these snakes could migrate to and flourish in as much as a third of the continental United States, including all three coasts.U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (2008-02-20). USGS Maps Show Potential Non-Native Python Habitat Along Three U.S. Coasts. www.usgs.gov, last accessed 2008-03-11. However, a subsequent study produced a map incorporating both climatic extremes and averages which projected that the Burmese python's range as limited to Southern Florida.Pyron RA, Burbrink FT, Guiher TJ (2008) Claims of Potential Expansion throughout the U.S. by Invasive Python Species Are Contradicted by Ecological Niche Models. PLoS ONE 3(8): e2931. Also, this projection was criticized in an unsigned Axcess News article as not having been peer-reviewed., Axcess News (2012-03-12). U.S. Fish and Wildlife turn blind eye to science, fact. www.axcessnews.com, last accessed 2012-03-12. Burmese pythons kept throughout winter in an experimental enclosure in South Carolina all died during the study, apparently because they could not properly acclimate to the cold, but most survived extended periods at temperatures below those typical of southern Florida.Recently published in Integrative Zoology the study \u2018Environmental, physiology and behavior limit the range expansion of invasive Burmese pythons in southeastern USA\u2019 (Jacobson et al. 2012) contradicts the initial USGS study (Reed Rodda 2008) which claimed that non-native Burmese Pythons could expand as far north as the southern one third of the United States. Jacobson et al. (2012) along with three other cold climate studies, (Avery et al. 2010; Dorcas et al. 2011; Mazzotti et al. 2011) provide a combined claim that the Burmese Python will remain in the Everglades. Furthermore, other reputable herpetologists have commented on the controversial theory positing future migration past the Florida Everglades:The National Geographic Society's Resident Herpetologist, Dr. Brady Barr, said \"Climate data reveal that temperatures found in southern Florida simply are not conducive to the long term survival of large tropical snakes. When it gets cold, these snakes die.\" Dr. Barr also said \"Feral Hogs are a bigger problem for the Everglades than pythons. The press has sensationalized this story to the point that people think the sky is falling. Hopefully comprehensive research such as Jacobson et al. will put an end to the hysteria.\"http://usark.org/featured/new-python-cold-study"}]}

Although not listed on the IUCN Redlist, the species is listed on the Mexican Red List NOM-059-2001 as threatened and it is currently illegal to hunt them in Mexico. This protection does not apply to areas in North America where they have been introduced, however. Although hunting, trapping, and killing of these iguanas is illegal throughout Mexico; the Balsas depression along the borders of the states Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero is one of the largest illegal hunting and trading areas. The remoteness of the areas and lack of enforcement of the laws is seen as the main reason. A study is being conducted by the Instituto de Biologia, UNAM, to solve the over-exploitation problem and to determine if the iguanas can be successfully farmed as a food source similar to the Green Iguana and the closely related Ctenosaura similis."}, {"description": "The Mexican Spinytail Iguana was first described by German zoologist Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann in 1834. The generic name, Ctenosaura, is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (\u039a\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"comb\" (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (\u03c3\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1), meaning \"lizard\". Its specific name is the Latin word pectinata meaning \"combed\", also referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back. The genus it belongs to represents the most diverse group of iguanas with 15 currently recognized species. These species inhabit lowland (below 1200m elevation) dry forests on both coasts of Mexico and Central America. All species of Ctenosaura fall within one of seven clades. Distributions of these clades fall geographically within well established areas. Closely related species show allopatry whereas species from divergent clades show sympatry. Phylogenic study shows this species to be most closely related to C. acanthura, the Northeastern spinytail iguana.De Queiroz, Kevin. (1987): Phylogenetic systematics of iguanine lizards: a comparative osteological study. University of California Publishing, 118:1-203. Additional mitochondrial DNA research is being performed to determine whether additional subspecies may exist. Because of the different human cultures throughout this species distribution, the clades are being evaluated for their impact from humans. For example, these iguanas are not eaten in their northern ranges by humans as they are in the southern ranges, but the hatchlings in the southern ranges have a better survival rate due to better environmental conditions."}, {"description": "Mating occurs in the spring. Males show dominance and interest by head bobbing, eventually chasing the female until he can catch her and subdue her. Within eight to ten weeks, the female will dig a nest and lay clutches of up to 50 eggs in a burrow of loose soil. These eggs hatch in 90 days with the bright green babies digging their way out of the sand."}, {"description": "In Mexico it is found from central Sinaloa to southern Chiapas. It has also been introduced to the United States in the very southern tip of the state of Texas and in the state of Florida."}, {"description": "The Mexican Spinytail Iguana is native to Western Mexico from Sinaloa to Oaxaca.This iguana has been introduced to Brownsville, Texas and South Florida and reproduces in the wild in several feral populations. On the south-eastern Florida coast, these iguanas have been found on Key Biscayne, Hialeah, and in Broward County. On the south-western Florida coast, it has been reported on Gasparilla Island. It is currently estimated as of December 2007 that there are 12,000 iguanas on this island, descended from a trio of pet lizards released by a resident in the 1970s.They are regarded as a \"nuisance animal\" on Gasparilla island because the iguanas eat ornamental flowers and shrubs and prey on nesting birds and sea turtle eggs. They have been known to chew through electrical and telephone cables. They may also carry salmonella and their prehistoric appearance has been known to scare residents. As the iguanas like to burrow in the sand it is feared that their tunnels could cause dunes and even seawalls to collapse and deprive the island of crucial protection from landfalling hurricanes."}, {"description": "Mexican Spinytail Iguanas have distinctive keeled scales on their long tails, which gives them their common name. They are one of the larger members of the genus Ctenosaura, capable of growing to 140 cm (4.6 feet) in length, with females being slightly smaller than males at 100 cm, and are typically brown or grey-brown in coloration with a yellowish ventral surface. They have a crest of long spines which extend down the center of their back. Hatchlings are often a bright green color with no pattern and darken as they age."}, {"description": "The Mexican Spiny-tailed iguana is a social lizard, which has adapted to living in groups as opposed to other species of Ctenosaura which tend to be solitary animals. These iguanas are excellent climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat with plenty of crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. They are often found dwelling near or in towns in their native Mexico and where they have been introduced elsewhere.They are primarily herbivorous, eating a variety of flowers, leaves, stems, and fruit, but they will opportunistically eat small animals, eggs, and arthropods."}, {"description": "Ctenosaura pectinata, commonly known as the Mexican spiny-tailed iguana or the Mexican spinytail iguana, is a moderate-sized lizard endemic to western Mexico."}]}

It is described as one of the Madtsoiidae family, that includes the species such as Wonambi naracoortensis, present in Australia until the Pleistocene. The name of the genus is derived from traditional name given by the people of Arnhem Land to the Rainbow serpent. They were large snakes, up to 6 metres long and 300 millimetres thick, that are more closely resemble Varanus (Monitors) than small burrowing lizards. John Scanlon has presented this as evidence of descent from the former, rather than burrowing ancestors that evolved into the elongate and legless snakes. The fossil material described by this species includes a rare example of a complete skull and mandible, often crushed in the fossilisation process, that was preserved in the soft limestone of a body of fresh water. This was found at the Riversleigh fossil site in northwest Queensland.The type locality is Bullock Creek, which occurs on the Camfield bed formations given in the specific epithet.Yurlunggur camfieldensis in the Paleobiology Database"}]}

Their undersides range from white, off white, very pale green, or pale yellow. But their throats are considered to be more attractive, which can be quite colorful (blue and purple, or peach), some with a single color, some with stripes. Adult males have larger, more triangular heads than females, and develop larger crests on the head, neck and tail, and are larger in general. The tail, slightly over two-thirds of the entire body length, can be used as a weapon, for balance, and to assist swimming.Like many other reptiles the Chinese water dragon possesses a small, iridescent, photosensitive spot between their eyes referred to as the pineal eye (or parietal eye, or colloquially as the third eye) that is thought to help thermoregulate their bodies by sensing differences in light to assist with basking and seeking shelter after sunset. Since it recognizes differences in light, the parietal eye can also help the lizard avoid predation from birds and other aerial threats, and can awaken from deep sleep from even slight changes in light from overhead. Habitat and behaviorsNative to the lowland and highland forests of southern China and southeastern Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma), Chinese water dragons are most commonly found along the banks of freshwater lakes and streams. They are active during the day (diurnal), and spend most of their time in the trees or plants (arboreal). If threatened, the dragon will drop from the trees into the water and either swim to safety or remain submerged for up to 25 minutes. Water dragons live in areas with average humidity levels of 40\u201380% and temperatures ranging from 80\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C).

There are four species however that are exceptionally closely related to the leopard gecko, one of which was previously included as a subspecies of leopard gecko: In addition, there are five subspecies of leopard gecko:"}, {"description": "Sexual dimorphism is defined as a phenotypic difference between males and females of a species. It can be commonly found in animals, such as the leopard gecko and other reptiles. It exists in adult males and females, but can be difficult to determine in young geckos. The underside of a gecko truly determines the sex of the gecko. Males have pre-anal pores and hemipenal bulges while females have smaller pores and do not have external bulges.Males can determine the sex of other leopard geckos by smelling pheromones on their skin. Males respond to males with aggressive behavior while they demonstrate courtship behavior towards females. Towards other males, the male would raise itself up from the ground, extend his limbs, and arch his back with the swelling of the tongue in aggression. He will then make short dashes and quick, vigorous bites, which frequently lacerate the skin and sometimes severely injure his opponent. Males behave the same way towards females while they are shedding their skin. Before and after the shedding of the skin, the males still express courtship behavior towards the females."}, {"description": "Leopard geckos are also known to have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Research shows that more females can be produced in predominantly cool temperatures (about 26 \u2013) and very warm temperatures (about 34 \u2013). It was recorded that males can be produced at the intermediate temperatures (about 31 \u2013). Females born in the higher temperatures differed from those who were born in the lower temperatures hormonally and behaviorally. Those born in the warmer temperatures expressed more aggressive behavior. These are known as \"hot females\" and are often determined to be infertile.Leopard geckos will breed typically in the summer. Females can store sperm over the course of their breeding season, so they can produce up to three clutches from one or two copulations, therefore, the male is not needed for reproductive success after the first or second copulation. Once the female has mated and received sperm, she will need an abundance of calcium for health and to ensure that the eggs calcify properly. She can lay about six to eight clutches, which consists of two eggs in each clutch. They will normally lay two eggs approximately 21 to 28 days after mating. After 45 to 60 days, droplets of moisture will appear on the shell and the shell will begin to shrink and partially collapse. These are indications that the eggs will hatch. Baby leopard geckos will have an \"egg tooth\", a calcareous tip at the end of its snout to help break their egg shell. Their \"egg tooth\" will fall off within one to two days. In addition to this, their skin will usually shed within 24 hours of hatching. The leopard gecko hatchling will not be able to eat until after the first shedding."}, {"description": "Leopard geckos are one of the most popular reptile pets. They are possibly the first domesticated lizard species. Their small size, robustness, and relatively easy care makes them a good \"beginner\" reptile pet. They breed easily in captivity, so most sold today are captive-bred rather than wild-caught."}, {"description": "The native habitat of the leopard gecko is the rocky, dry grassland and desert regions of south-Asian Afghanistan, Pakistan, north-west India, and some parts of Iran. Winter temperatures in these areas can be quite low, below 10 C, forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called brumation, living on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are crepuscular reptiles; they are limited to the burrows during the day but become active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable. These geckos are solitary, and do not usually live with other animals."}, {"description": "Leopard geckos feed on crickets, roaches, waxworms, mealworms, super worms, other insects, earth worms, pinky mice (although these have fatty livers). In captivity, most individuals will prefer hunting food themselves. The majority of captive leopard geckos will also refuse to eat dead prey. Crickets are the most common food source to give them in captivity, as they can hunt them in their enclosure the way they would in their natural environment, though mealworms and certain species of roach are also common. When food is scarce in the desert, they can rely on their ability to store excess fat in their tails. Sufficient calcium and vitamin D3 is also very important for their diet: How they obtain it in the wild is still unknown, although they likely receive this from their varied prey of moths, spiders, ants, and other insects. In captivity, it is near impossible to completely duplicate the diet they will have in the wild, so the most nutritious insects known are offered, usually dusted with a fine calcium powder with added vitamin D3 and sometimes gut loaded by feeding. Also, their keen sense of smell and sight allows them to search for food in the wild, they will stalk their prey somewhat like an actual leopard will, moving their tail, and then striking when they are satisfied."}, {"description": "Leopard geckos have predators such as snakes, foxes and other large reptiles. Their keen sense of hearing and sight help them escape from them during the night. Along with their exceptional sight and hearing abilities, their skin helps camouflage themselves from their predators. Their sense of taste and smell also helps them with survival. The shedding of their skin also removes any scent markers left behind for potential predators to discover. They also stay in underground holes and burrows during the daytime, not only avoid the heat, but to also avoid the risk of getting eaten.Leopard geckos also have the ability to voluntarily detach their tails if it is attacked, grabbed by the tail, bitten during copulation, or nipped by another during feeding. This is called caudal autotomy. After autotomy the tail can continue to twitch for as long as 30 minutes, allowing the gecko to escape from its predator. The tail is large and at least in one related species (Christinus marmoratus) it has been reported that the tail-less fleeing gecko makes for a quicker getaway. Fractures in the tailbone allow the tail to separate easily and rapid vasoconstriction allows the gecko to suffer minimal blood loss. This detaching of the tail causes a high level of stress on the gecko due to the loss of the valuable storage of fat it once had. It will start to regenerate its tail immediately because it is needed for survival. A lost tail may increase the chance of sickness in the gecko and in some cases kill it, but this is very rare. Regenerated tails often retain similar colors to the original tail [though there will most likely be a wide variance from the vibrancy and patterns of the original], however they are often smooth and lack the rigid qualities and length of a normal tail. The tail will also be shorter and often fatter than the previous tail."}, {"description": "Captive born and bred leopard geckos do not carry any diseases that are transmissible to humans. Salmonella is not an issue, because they live in a dry environment and the disease usually occurs in aquatic or semi-aquatic species kept in unsanitary housing conditions.http://www.reptilia.org/pdfs/habitarium/HabitariumPrograms-GeckoQuickFactSheet.pdf However, there are several common diseases that leopard geckos may experience. Gastoenteritis, caused by bacterial or protozoan (especially Coccidia) infection brought on my such things as unsanitary conditions, can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea. As a result, geckos may present with watery and/or bloody stool. Normally the stool is dry and well-formed with a small white portion. It is contagious and can be spread easily. Other symptoms of the disease include weight loss, a skinny tail, undigested cricket masses. If it is not treated, the gecko will stop eating, become dehydrated and scrawny, and possibly die. Metabolic bone disease or MBD is a nutritional deficiency caused by a lack of calcium and vitamin D3 in the diet. Calcium and vitamin D3 are critical for proper bone formation during development and for proper calcification of eggs for a pregnant female. Geckos with MBD will experience symptoms such as weakness, bones becoming spongy, deformities in their limbs and spine, twitching or tremors, and a lack of appetite. Recovering from this disease can be very difficult. Anorexia in leopard geckos can be caused by stress, unsanitary conditions, nutritional diseases, or other diseases. Anorexic leopard geckos appear thin, develop an extremely thin tail, become weak and sluggish, stop eating, and usually die if untreated. Dysecdysis is a condition in which a leopard gecko has problems shedding its skin due to poor nutrition, lack of humidity and moisture, and poor care. Incompletely shed skin will appear as dry patches on various areas of the body such as the head, eyes, limbs, and tail. Leopard geckos with this condition may develop eye problems, have difficulty in walking, and noticeable constricting bands of old skin around their limbs. If the condition is not treated, it could lead to infection. Pneumonia is a severe respiratory tract infection that can be caused by bacteria in the lungs. Leopard geckos may be susceptible to this if their environment is too cool and humid thus compromising their immune system. Mucus bubbles appear in the nostril area of geckos with pneumonia, and they have difficulty breathing. The problem is usually resolved when the environment temperature rises to about 82 to. Sand impactions and prolapse can occasionally occur. This condition may result if a leopard gecko ingests sand or other substrates they live on."}, {"description": "Leopard geckos are large for a gecko. Hatchlings tend to be 6.5 to 8.4\u00a0cm (2.6 to 3.3\u00a0inches) in length and weighing about 3\u00a0grams while the adult geckos are about 20.5 to 27.5\u00a0cm (8.1 to 11\u00a0inches) in length and weight about 45 to 65\u00a0grams. Those found in the wild typically have a darker, dull, and drab coloration than those kept in captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns. The skin of a leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection from the rough sand and rocky hills terrain of their dry environment. Their dorsal side is covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side is thin, transparent, and smooth. Like all reptiles, leopard geckos shed their skin. In the few days before the shedding, the skin will turn color to a translucent whitish gray. Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much. The gecko will eat its old skin after shedding, revealing a brighter colored one. There are two theories of why leopard geckos do this. One is that in the wild leopard geckos eat their shed skin so there is no trace that the leopard gecko was there. The other theory is that eating the shed skin is a means for obtaining protein and other vitamins for growth.Leopard geckos are ectothermic. They absorb warmth and energy during the day as they are sleeping, so they can hunt and digest food at night. In addition, they have short legs, which enable them to be quick and agile while their small nails allow them to climb twigs and rocks. Leopard geckos have openings on either side of their head as ears. A tympanic membrane covers and protects it. They use their ears to locate their prey. Healthy leopard geckos have thick, fleshy tails; a thin tail is an indication that the gecko is not healthy and may be lacking nutrition. Although, when in captivity, the tail can be fattened by the feeding of waxworms (wax moth larvae), these worms are typically too fatty for the gecko to get the nutritional value it needs. They can also be fed \"pinkys\", a one day old mouse to fatten up the tail, but again, these are very low in nutritional value. Breeders recommend coating crickets in a nutritional powder before serving them either live or dead. Leopard geckos' thick tails can regenerate when lost; however, the regenerated tails appear stumpy and never have the same appearance as the original tail. Unlike many other geckos, but like other Eublepharis, their toes do not have adhesive lamellae, so they cannot climb smooth vertical walls.

This is because the lizards start off with twice the amount of chromosomes as regular lizards. They maintain diversity by combining sister chromosomes instead of pairing their homologous chromosomes. With current studies this suggest the lizards can somehow distinguish between homologous and sister chromosomes.Harmon Katherine (2010) No Sex Needed: All-Female Lizard Species Cross Their Chromosomes to Make Babies. www.scientificamerican.com/article/asexual-lizards/ The lizard is a triploid unisexual species that reproduce asexually.

Captive snakes have been observed taking earthworms offered by hand, but dead prey items are never taken. The snake will search actively for prey, often on the edges of water, using sight and sense of smell (using the Jacobson's organ). They consume prey live without using constriction. Habitat Grass snakes are strong swimmers and may be found close to fresh water, although there is evidence individual snakes often do not need bodies of water throughout the entire season.The preferred habitat appears to be open woodland and \"edge\" habitat, such as field margins and woodland borders, as these may offer adequate refuge while still affording ample opportunity for thermoregulation through basking. Pond edges are also favoured and the relatively high chance of observing this secretive species in such areas may account for their perceived association with ponds and water.Grass snakes, as with most reptiles, are at the mercy of the thermal environment and need to overwinter in areas which are not subject to freezing. Thus, they typically spend the winter underground where the temperature is relatively stable. Reproduction As spring approaches, the males emerge first and spend much of the day basking in an effort to raise body temperature and thereby metabolism. This may be a tactic to maximise sperm production, as the males mate with the females as soon as they emerge up to two weeks later in April, or earlier if environmental temperatures are favourable. The leathery-skinned eggs are laid in batches of eight to 40 in June to July and hatch after about 10 weeks. To survive and hatch, the eggs require a temperature of at least 21 C, but preferably 28 C, with high humidity. Rotting vegetation, such as compost heaps, are preferred locations. The young are about 18 cm long when they hatch and are immediately independent. MigrationAfter breeding in summer, snakes tend to hunt and may range widely during this time, moving up to several hundred metres in a day. Prey items tend to be large compared to the size of the snake, and this impairs the movement ability of the snake. Snakes which have recently eaten rarely move any significant distance and will stay in one location, basking to optimize their body temperature until the prey item has been digested. Individual snakes may only need two or three significant prey items throughout an entire season. Ecdysis (moulting)Ecdysis occurs at least once during the active season. As the outer skin wears and the snake grows, the new skin forms underneath the old, including the eye scales which may turn a milky blue/white colour at this time - referred to as being 'in blue'. The blue white colour comes from an oily secretion between the old and new skins, the snakes coloration will also look dull, like the animal is dusty. This process affects the eyesight of the snakes and they do not move or hunt during this time, they are also, in common with most other snakes, more aggressive. The outer skin is eventually sloughed in one piece (inside-out) and normal movement activity is resumed. Defence Not being venomous, the snake's only defence is to produce a garlic-smelling fluid from the anal glands, or to feign death (thanatosis) by becoming completely limp. They may also perform an aggressive display in defence, hissing and striking without actually opening the mouth. They rarely bite in defence. They may also secrete blood (autohaemorrhage) from the mouth and nose whilst playing dead. When caught they often regurgitate the contents of their stomachs. Protection and threatsThe species has various predator species, including corvids, storks, owls and perhaps other birds of prey, foxes and the domestic cat. In England, grass snakes are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and cannot be harmed or traded without a licence, although they may legally be captured and kept in captivity.Two of the subspecies are considered critically endangered: N. n. cetti (Sardinian grass snake) and N. n. schweizeri.

It is also found in Middle East and northwestern Africa. British grass snakes belong to the subspecies N. n. helvetica.This species is one of only three snakes to occur in Great Britain, and is distributed throughout lowland areas of England and Wales; it is almost absent from Scotland and is not found in Ireland, which has no native snakes."}, {"description": "The grass snake is typically dark green or brown in colour with a characteristic yellow collar behind the head, which explains the alternative name ringed snake. The colour may also range from grey to black, with darker colours being more prevalent in colder regions, presumably owing to the thermal benefits of being dark in colour. The underside is whitish with irregular blocks of black, which are useful in recognizing individuals. In Great Britain, the grass snake is the largest reptile, reaching up to 190 cm total length, though such large specimens are rare. Females are considerably larger than males, typically reaching a size of 90 - when fully grown. Males are approximately 50 cm shorter and significantly smaller in girth. Weight is about 240 g.

The proposed subspecies martinensis and taylori are probably not valid. The populations on \u00c1ngel de la Guarda, Mejia and Rasa Islands almost certainly constitute a separate species closer to Uta palmeri, and that of San Esteban Island may so too, being close to squamata.

It is notable for having a unique form of polymorphism wherein each of the three different male morphs utilizes a different strategy in acquiring mates. The three morphs compete against each other following a pattern of rock, paper, scissors, where one morph has advantages over another but is outcompeted by the third.The specific epithet stansburiana is in honor of Captain Howard Stansbury of the US Corps of Topographical Engineers, who collected the first specimens while leading the 1849-1851 expedition to explore and survey the Great Salt Lake of Utah.Moll, Edward. 2005. Uta stansburiana, Baird and Girard, 1852 - Common Side-blotched Lizard. Sonoran Herpetologist."}, {"description": "Mating Rock-paper-scissor mechanismMale side-blotched lizards exhibit distinct polymorphism in their throat colors, and can be divided into three different categories. Each of these three different morphs varies in how it competes for mates, and variation within a breeding population is maintained by a rock-paper-scissors mechanism of frequency-dependent sexual selection. A cycle is created where the least common morph of one breeding season often has the largest number of mature living offspring in the next year. This is because one morph does particularly well against another, but poorly in comparison to the third. Orange-throated males are \u201cultradominant\u201d. They are the largest and most aggressive morph, defending relatively large (about 100 m2 or 120 yd2) territories and keeping harems of females with which they mate. They are adept at stealing mates from blue-throated individuals, but are vulnerable to cuckoldry by the yellow-throated female mimics. Orange-throated males also have significantly reduced yearly survival rates compared to the other two morphs. Blue-throated males are \"dominant\". They are intermediate in size, and guard smaller territories containing only a single female. As they only have one mate to defend, they are better at catching yellow-throated sneaks, but are also susceptible to having their mates stolen by the larger, more aggressive orange-throated males. Yellow-throated males are \u201csneakers\u201d. Their coloration is similar to that of sexually mature females, and they typically mimic female \u201crejection\u201d displays when they encounter dominant orange- or blue-throated males. Unlike the other morphs, yellow-throated males do not hold territories. Instead, they have wide-reaching home ranges that may overlap with several other lizards\u2019 territories. They rely on their mimicry to sneak matings with unattended females. This is more easily achieved among the harems kept by orange-throated males than by the single, closely guarded mate of the blue-throated males. Though orange-throated males have the highest mortality rates, yellow-throated males have higher relative rates of posthumous fertilization (posthumous birth), indicating an increased reliance on sperm competition as part of their reproductive strategy. Yellow-throated males can in specific instances transform into blue-throated males over the course of the breeding season. This transformation is usually triggered by the death of a nearby dominant male, and the blue patches the yellow-throated males develop is qualitatively distinct from the blue patches of genetically blue-throated males. Not all yellow-throated males transform, but when they do, they give up their female mimicry and adopt the \u201cdominant\u201d morph's behavior pattern. No transformations in the other direction, in which dominant males gain yellow-throat coloration, have been observed. Female side-blotched lizards have also been shown to exhibit behaviorally correlated differences in throat coloration. Orange-throated females are considered r-strategists. They typically produce large clutches consisting of many small eggs. In contrast, yellow-throated females are K-strategists that lay fewer, larger eggs. Like the male morphs, the frequencies of these two female morphs also cycle with time. However, the cycle is shorter \u2013 two years in comparison to the male morphs\u2019 four- or five-year cycle \u2013 and is not a result of frequency-dependent sexual selection. Instead, orange-throated females are more successful at lower population densities, where competition for food is less fierce and less selection pressure from predation occurs. When population density is high and or when predators abound, yellow-throated females tend to have higher reproductive success. In general, their larger hatchlings have higher short-term and long-term survival rates, and these advantages are magnified in times of scarcity. Side-blotched lizards show displays and aggression shortly after hatching, and even minute differences in size can lead to increased social dominance and capacity to outcompete the smaller hatchlings. Genetic determination of throat-color polymorphismAnalysis of DNA nuclear microsatellites has provided genetic evidence for the rock-paper-scissors behavior pattern of male side-blotched lizard competition. In populations where all three morphs are present, shared paternity between yellow- and blue-throated individuals occurs at a rate significantly below random chance, while shared paternity between yellow- and orange-throated males occurs at a rate significantly above chance. In addition, blue-throated males often shared paternity with orange-throated males, despite having mostly yellow-throated neighbors.Blood plasma testosterone levels play an important role in the creation of the three male morphs both during and after development. Orange-throated males have 46-48% higher plasma testosterone levels compared to their yellow- or blue-throated counterparts. Experimental elevation of plasma testosterone levels in the other two male morphs led to increases in endurance, aggressiveness, and territory size to the degree expressed by normal orange-throated males. In addition, the transformation of yellow-throated males to blue-throated males is accompanied by an increase in their plasma testosterone levels.Throat color in side-blotched lizards is genetically determined, and has high heritability. It is determined by a single Mendelian factor with three alleles. In males, the o allele is the dominant allele, and the b allele is recessive to the y allele. Therefore, phenotypically orange-throated males have genotypes of either oo, ob, or oy. Yellow-throated males have genotypes of either yy or yb, and blue-throated males are exclusively bb. In females, all individuals with the dominant o allele are orange-throated, while those lacking an o allele develop yellow throats. ReproductionFemale side-blotched lizards lay clutches with an average of 5.1 eggs and a maximum of 9 eggs in a single clutch. Smaller clutch sizes, often associated with yellow-throated females, have an increased frequency of eggs bursting upon being laid or egg binding, suggesting an upper physiological limit to how much a female can invest in each individual egg she lays. Aggression and courtshipDominant male side-blotched lizards are aggressive in the defense of their territories. Upon spotting another conspecific within their territories, resident individuals enter a state of heightened alertness. They perform one or more \u201cpushups\u201d (vertical bobbing motions), arch their backs, and extend their limbs before approaching the intruder. If the intruder is another male, the resident follows up by rushing, butting, or nipping at the intruder, which will then usually proceed to run away. If it is a female, the resident will initiate courtship, which consists of circling, flank-biting, licking, smelling, shallower head-bobbing, and eventually copulation. Body shape and passivity are the main releasers for courtship activity, and males have been observed in trying to court and copulate with smaller lizards of other species, as well as smaller subordinate side-blotched lizards.Tail length is important in the determination of dominance hierarchies. Like many other lizard species, side-blotched lizards use tail autotomy as an escape mechanism. However, a reduction in tail length also confers a loss of social status for both males and females. Males will autotomize their tails less readily than will females, likely due to the increased importance of social status for males. Subordinate females can still mate, but male reproductive success is directly tied to their social status. FeedingSide-blotched lizards display feeding behavior which can be influenced by sex or season. In a study conducted by Best et al., these lizards were found to consume diets largely based upon arthropod populations within the area, within a given season. These populations vary by year, and different arthropod populations will fluctuate seasonally. The study showed a correlation between sex and diet, giving way to a number of theories that speculate why gender has an effect on feeding behavior and diet. One mechanism proposes the behavior differences depend on gender, such as guarding territories and attracting mates, are responsible for, or a contributing factor in, feeding behavior. Alternatively, the sexual difference in feeding behavior could also act in favor of reducing intraspecific competition for resources, with individuals eating prey appropriate for their respective size (ex. small females consuming smaller prey)."}, {"description": "The common side-blotched lizard is a species of small iguanid lizard. Males can grow up to 60\u00a0mm (2.4 inches) from snout to vent, while females are typically a little smaller. The degree of pigmentation varies with sex and population. Some males can have blue flecks spread over their backs and tails, and their sides may be yellow or orange, while others may be unpatterned. Females may have stripes along their backs/sides, or again may be relatively drab. Both sexes have a prominent blotch on their sides, just behind their front limbs. Coloration is especially important in common side-blotched lizards, as it is closely related to the mating behavior of both males and females."}]}

Gould's monitor is a terrestrial or \"ground-dwelling\" reptile that excavates large burrows for shelter. Rock escarpments and tree hollows are also suitable dwellings. V. gouldii inhabits a vast range throughout Australia, and reaches an average length of 140 cm and can weigh as much as 6 kg. They can be found in northern and eastern Australia, where they inhabit open woodlands and grasslands. V. g. flavirufus, a slightly smaller subspecies, resides in Australia's interior.

The similarities between the species and their close proximity frequently cause confusion.The sand monitor is a relentless forager. It is diurnal, meaning most of its activities take place during the day. Anything smaller than itself will be eagerly devoured. The diets of hatchlings and juveniles often consist mostly of insects and small lizards, but generally varies more with age. Adult monitors will prey on mice, small birds large insects, small lizard species, snakes, and carrion. They are seemingly immune to snake venom and will kill and eat even the most venomous species such as the Fierce Snake. The sand goanna does consume smaller species of monitors: Ackies, rock monitors and other dwarf species are often found and eaten. It is common to see a Gould's disturbing rock piles in an attempt to flush out any Odatria. It lays it eggs in termite mounds to protect them from the harsh desert climate. Like all goannas and Snakes the Sand Monitor has a forked tongue, for which they taste the air. scents are picked up on each side of the fork which when retracted brushes over an area in the mouth called the Jacobson's organ which identifies on which side the scent is the strongest. Upon identifying this difference in scent strength the Sand monitor can alter its direction accordingly."}, {"description": "Photo of Varanus gouldii at AROD.com.au Photo of Varanus gouldii at Pbase.com Cogger, H.

The Tombstone Epitaph of Tombstone, Arizona, wrote about a Gila monster that a local person caught on May 14, 1881: On May 8, 1890, southeast of Tucson, Arizona Territory, Empire Ranch owner Walter Vail captured and thought he had killed a Gila monster. He tied it to his saddle and it bit the middle finger of his right hand and wouldn't let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocketknife, cut open his finger to stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around his finger and wrist. They summoned Dr. John C. Handy of Tucson, who took Vail back to Tucson for treatment, but Vail experienced swollen and bleeding glands in his throat for sometime afterward.Dr. Handy's friend, Dr. George Goodfellow of Tombstone, was among the first to research the actual effects of Gila monster venom. Scientific American reported in 1890 that \"The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply\u2014the foul gas overcoming them.\" Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891 he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters but had not died from the bite.Goodfellow published articles about rattlesnake and Gila monster bites in Scientific American and Southern California Practitioner. Venom production The Gila monster produces venom in modified salivary glands in its lower jaw, unlike snakes, whose venom is produced in the upper jaw. The Gila monster lacks the musculature to forcibly inject the venom; instead, the venom is propelled from the gland to the tooth by chewing. Capillary action brings the venom out of the tooth and into the victim. The teeth are loosely anchored, which allows them to be broken off and replaced throughout life. Gila monsters have been observed to flip over while biting the victim, presumably to aid the flow of the venom into the wound. Because the Gila monster's prey consists mainly of eggs, small animals, and otherwise \"helpless\" prey, the Gila monster's venom is thought to have evolved for defensive rather than for hunting use. A defensive use would explain the Gila monster's bright warning coloration. Toxicity Although the venom is a neurotoxin as toxic as that of a coral snake, H. suspectum produces only small amounts. The Gila monster's bite is not fatal to healthy adult humans.http://www.historynet.com/the-gila-monster-had-a-killer-reputation.htm Accessed Nov 17, 2014: \"Although the Gila monster's bite is extremely painful, none have resulted in a verifiable human fatality to a healthy person.\" No reports of fatalities have been confirmed after 1939, and those recorded prior to that year are possibly iatrogenic, or resulting from attempts to treat the bite itself. The Gila monster can bite quickly (especially by swinging its head sideways) and hold on tenaciously and painfully. If bitten, the victim may need to fully submerge the attacking lizard in water to break free from its bite. Symptoms of the bite include excruciating pain, edema, and weakness associated with a rapid drop in blood pressure.More than a dozen peptides and other substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including hyaluronidase, serotonin, phospholipase A2, and several kallikrein-like glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite. Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including horridum venom, which causes hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes)[1], and helothermine, which causes lethargy, partial paralysis of the limbs, and hypothermia in rats. Most are similar in form to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes smooth muscle and regulates water and electrolyte secretion between the small and large intestines. These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, has been shown to inhibit the growth of lung cancer.The constituents of the lizard's venom that have received the most attention from researchers are the bioactive peptides, including helodermin, helospectin, exendin-3, and exendin-4. Exendin-4 has formed the basis of a class of medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, known as Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists. Exenatide was the first product in the class to reach the market and was launched in 2005. Drug research In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss. The saliva of the Gila monster contains many chemicals which can be deadly. One of these has been shown to affect memory. Several companies have been researching the abilities of this chemical to help memory loss due to various diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Gilatide, derived from exendin-4, has been shown to dramatically heighten memory in a study with mice. Gilatide is likely to be researched further to provide help to Alzheimer\u2019s patients."}, {"description": "The Gila monster emerges from hibernation in January or February and mates in May and June. The male initiates courtship by flicking his tongue to search for the female's scent. If the female rejects his advances, she will bite him and crawl away. When successful, copulation has been observed to last from 15 minutes to as long as two and a half hours. The female lays eggs in July or August, burying them in sand 5 in below the surface. The clutch consists of two to 12 eggs: five is the average. The incubation lasts nine months, as the hatchlings emerge during April through June the following year. The hatchlings are about 16 cm long and can bite and inject venom upon hatching. The juveniles typically have larger bands of pink scales than adults, although the banded Gila monster (H. s. cinctum) has a tendency to retain the band pattern. H. suspectum sexually matures at three to five years old. After egg-laying, adult Gila monsters gradually spend less time on the surface to avoid the hottest part of the summer (although they may be active in the evening), eventually starting their hibernation around November.Little is known about the social behavior of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it has one of the highest aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity."}, {"description": "Gila monsters spend 90% of their time underground in burrows or rocky shelters. They are active in the morning during the dry season (spring and early summer); later in the summer, they may be active on warm nights or after a thunderstorm. They maintain a surface body temperature of about 30 C. Gila monsters are slow in sprinting ability, but they have relatively high endurance and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max) for a lizard. They are preyed upon by coyotes and raptors. Diet The Gila monster eats small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, insects, and carrion. The Gila monster feeds primarily on bird and reptile eggs, and eats infrequently (only five to ten times a year in the wild), but when it does feed, it may eat up to one-third of its body mass. It uses its extremely acute sense of smell to locate prey, especially eggs. Its sense of smell is so keen, it can locate and dig up chicken eggs buried 15 cm deep and accurately follow a trail made by rolling an egg.Prey may be crushed to death if large or eaten alive if small, swallowed head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably as a result of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs."}, {"description": "The Gila monster is found in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range including Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (but not Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland."}, {"description": "The two subspecies of Gila monster are the reticulated Gila monster (H. s. suspectum) and the banded Gila monster (H. s. cinctum). The reticulated Gila monster lives in the southern region of the Gila monster's range, while the banded Gila monster is a northern subspecies occurring primarily in the Mojave Desert. The reticulated Gila monster tends to have its lighter markings broken up by dark scales, giving it a reticulated pattern, while the banded Gila monster generally has more unbroken bands of lighter scales. In this species, the largest extant lizard native to North America north of the Mexican border (non-natives like green iguanas are larger), snout-to-vent length is from 26 to. The tail is about 20% of the body size and the largest specimens may reach 51 to in total length. Body mass is typically in the range of 350 to, with 11 males having been found to average 468 g. Reportedly, the very heaviest, largest specimens can weigh as much as 2300 g.Christel, C. M., DeNardo, D. F., & Secor, S. M. (2007).

Biology of Gila monsters and beaded lizards (Vol. 9). University of California Press.The Gila monster has one close living relative, the beaded lizard (H. horridum), as well as many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may be traced back to the Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000\u20138,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.The name \"Gila\" refers to the Gila River Basin in Arizona, where the Gila monster was once plentiful. Heloderma means \"studded skin\", from the Ancient Greek words helos (\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), \"the head of a nail or stud\", and derma (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1), \"skin\". Suspectum comes from the describer, paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who suspected the lizard might be venomous due to the grooves in the teeth."}, {"description": "Urban sprawl and habitat destruction has adversely affected Gila monster numbers. In 1952, they became the first venomous animal to be given legal protection. Gila monsters are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. In 1963, the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo to successfully breed Gila monsters in captivity. Relationship with humans Though the Gila monster is venomous, its laggard movement means it poses little threat to humans. However, it has earned a fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the Gila monster had a mixed standing. The Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The Gila monster has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant Gila Monster. It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several feet in the air to attack. Another myth held that the Gila monster did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and \"fetid breath\". The official mascot of Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy hat-wearing Gila monster. A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill voiced by Ray Winstone."}, {"description": "The Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum, ) is a species of venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexican state of Sonora.
