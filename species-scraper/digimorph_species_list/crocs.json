This allows them access to resources normally lost to these other species. Their skin is not wanted for leather production because it contains osteoderms. The only skin on their bodies which does not contain osteoderms are their sides. Therefore, hunting of this species is relatively low. In most countries, hunting this species is legal. Venezuela permits hunting every fall, providing the number of kills does not exceed 150,000 for that season. The skin that is salvageable will be harvested. It is commonly found in the American market, sometimes mislabeled as Alligator mississippiensis.About four million spectacled caimans are found in Venezuela. Recent surveys show the population is expected to continue to increase. This is an example of how well the species is able to adapt. However, it is difficult to determine how well the species is doing on a global scale, since populations are not doing well in other countries, including Peru and El Salvador. Despite being commonly mistaken as this species, the incredibly large population of caimans living within the Brazilian pantanal are a separate species, the Yacare caiman. More up-to-date surveys are required for clarification, and to examine the interactions between the different subspecies. Further taxonomic work would make control measures easier to implement, as identification of different subspecies currently can be difficult. The major threat to this species and its subspecies is currently illegal hunting. Smuggling rings operating from Thailand and Singapore are extremely damaging to individual populations, and greater control measures and more effective legislation are needed.

Older animals are capable of taking larger, mammalian prey (e.g. wild pigs). As conditions become drier, caimans stop feeding. In areas where this species has become depleted, fish populations have also shown a decline. Until recently, C. crocodilus was thought to overeat the fish and snail populations. Some suggest they control piranha populations. However, piranhas have not been found to be a normal diet component. The Yacare caiman does demonstrate this particular dietary preference. In reality, C. crocodilus likely is very much a generalist and adaptive predator, given its ecological success. ReproductionThe spectacled caiman reaches sexual maturity from four to seven years old. Usually, the more dominant individuals mature more quickly. They gather and mate during the dry season. After mating season ends, the females build nests out of dense vegetation. The size of the nest varies depending on the resources available to the female.Magnusson, W.E. Vliet, K.A. Pooley, A.C. and Whitaker, R. \"Reproduction.\" Crocodiles and Alligators. Ross, C.A. Garnett, S. Dr. Facts on File, New York. 1989. 118-124. Each female can lay up to 40 eggs. The larger females have recently been found to lay larger eggs than smaller females lay.Campos, Z.

April 2008. 91. Most caimans nest during the wet season. It is very unusual to see a caiman nest during any winter months; the temperature is too low for the eggs. Temperature is important to the developing eggs, so females build their nests in a way that insulates them from extreme temperature changes. The nests are made of vegetation; as the vegetation decays, the nests produce heat which can keep the eggs about 5\u00b0C warmer than if they were insulated by mud alone. Heat not only incubates the eggs, but also determines the sex of the developing caimans. When the temperature inside the nest is about 31\u00b0C or lower, the caiman will become male. However, when the temperature is about 32\u00b0C or higher, they become female.Lang, J.W. \"Sex Determination.\"Crocodiles and Alligators. Ross, C.A. Garnett, S. Dr. Facts on File, New York. 1989. 120. Young caimans do not hatch with the dark-green colouring of their parents. They are yellow with black spots. This colouration will eventually fade away. Spectacled caimans have strongly protective maternal behaviour. They raise their young in cr\u00e8ches, one female taking care of her own, as well as several others' offspring.Life in Cold Blood: Giants They take care of their young for the first two to four months after the eggs hatch, the time it takes for the floods of the wet season to subside."}, {"description": "The spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), also known as the white caiman or common caiman, is a crocodilian reptile found in much of Central and South America.

This species is not typically found in groups, except during the onset of the breeding season. The female constructs a mound nest consisting mainly of plant matter. Nests are sited on the banks of rivers, and construction generally begins at the onset of the wet season, although breeding is asynchronous even within members of one population. It has a similar, but generally shorter nesting season than that of the sympatric dwarf crocodile, which may nest further from the riverine habitat frequented by C. cataphractus.The slender-snouted crocodile lays an average of 16 (minimum 13, maximum 27) very large eggs (relative to body size) about a week after completion of the mound nest. The incubation period is long compared with most other crocodilian species, sometimes lasting over 110 days. The female remains close to the nest, but does not defend it with the same vigor as some other species of crocodilians. Once the eggs begin to hatch, and the juveniles emit their characteristic chirping, she will break open the nest and assist in the hatching process. Hatchlings then disperse across the flooded forest floor. Although losses from predators do occur (e.g. by soft-shelled turtles), they apparently are minimal, possibly accounting for the small number of relatively large eggs laid, and the long incubation period.

The drastic decline in the gharial population can be attributed to a variety of causes, including overhunting for skins and trophies, egg collection for consumption, killing for indigenous medicine and killing by fishermen. Hunting is no longer considered to be a significant threat. However, the wild population of gharials has declined by about 58% between 1997 and 2006 because of: the increasing intensity of fishing and the use of gill nets throughout most of the present gharial habitat, even in protected areas; the loss of riverine habitat to dams, barrages, irrigation canals, siltation, changes in river course, artificial embankments, sand-mining, riparian agriculture, and domestic and feral livestock. In December 2007, several gharials were found dead in the Chambal River.

They are generally residents of flowing rivers with deep pools that have high sand banks and good fish stocks. Exposed sand banks are used for nesting. DietThe elongated, narrow snout reduces resistance to water when snagging fish, and the very sharp interdigitated teeth are well adapted for capturing fish. Young gharials eat insects, tadpoles, small fish and frogs. Adults feed on fish and small crustaceans. Their jaws are too thin and delicate to grab larger prey, especially a person. They catch fish by lying in wait for fish to swim by, and then catch the fish by quickly whipping their heads sideways and grabbing it in their jaws. They herd fish with their bodies against the shore, and stun fish using their underwater jaw clap. They do not chew their prey, but swallow it whole. Gharials do not kill and eat humans. Jewellery found in their stomachs may have been the reason for the myth that gharials are man-eaters. They may have swallowed this jewellery as gastroliths used to aid digestion or buoyancy management. ReproductionMales mature at around 13 years old, which is when the ghara begins to grow on the snout. They advertise for mates by making hissing and buzzing noises as they patrol their territories, and may have a harem of females within a territory which they aggressively defend from other males. Females communicate their readiness to mate by raising their snouts upwards. During courtship, males and females follow prospective mates around until a suitable mate is chosen. Courtship also involves head and snout rubbing and mounting by both males and females.Gharials usually mate during December and January. During the dry season in March and April, they dig nests in a riverside sand or silt bank, 1 - away from the waterline. Using their hind feet, they dig 50 - deep holes, in which the female lays 20\u201395 eggs. The eggs are the largest of any crocodilian species and weigh an average of 160 g. After 71 to 93 days of incubation, young gharials hatch in July just before the onset of the rainy season. Their sex is most likely determined by temperature, like in other crocodilians too. Female gharials dig up the young in response to hatching chirps, but do not assist the hatchlings to reach the water. They guard the hatchlings for some time."}, {"description": "Gharials once thrived in all the major river systems of the Indian Subcontinent, spanning the rivers of its northern part from the Indus River in Pakistan across the Gangetic floodplain to the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar.

This drastic decline has happened within a period of nine years, well within the span of one generation, and qualifies the gharial for Critically Endangered listing by the IUCN. Estimates from population surveys carried out in 2007 indicated 200\u2013300 breeding adults left in the world.Gharial Conservation Alliance (2008). Mass Gharial Deaths in Chambal. International Reptile Conservation Foundation, San Jose. In situ initiatives Conservation programs have been undertaken in India and Nepal, based on the establishment of protected areas and restocking these with animals born in captivity, but nowhere has restocking re-established viable populations. Juvenile gharials were released into largely inhospitable habitats in Indian and Nepali rivers and left to their fate. Reintroduction did not work so well, largely due to growing and uncontrolled anthropogenic pressures, including depletion of fish resources. Monitoring has not been consistently carried out, and little research on adaptation, migration and other key aspects has been conducted.Project Crocodile began in 1975 under the auspices of the Government of India with the aid of the United Nations Development Fund and Food and Agriculture Organization. The project included an intensive captive breeding and rearing program intended to restock habitats with low numbers of gharials. An acute shortage of gharial eggs was overcome by their purchase from Nepal. A male gharial was flown in from the Frankfurt Zoo to become one of the founding animals of the breeding program. Sixteen crocodile rehabilitation centers and five crocodile sanctuaries including the National Chambal Sanctuary and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary were established in India between 1975 and 1982. By 2004, 12,000 gharial eggs had been collected from wild and captive-breeding nests, and over 5,000 gharials reared to about a meter or more in length and released into the wild. But in 1991, funds were withdrawn for the captive-breeding and egg-collection programs. In 1997\u20131998, over 1,200 gharials and over 75 nests were located in the National Chambal Sanctuary, but no surveys were carried out between 1999 and 2003.In December 2010, the then Indian Minister for Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh, visited the Madras Crocodile Bank with Romulus Whitaker, and announced the formation of a National Tri-State Chambal Sanctuary Management and Coordination Committee for gharial conservation on 1600 km2 of the National Chambal Sanctuary along the Chambal River in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The committee will comprise representatives of three states' Water Resources Ministries, states' Departments of Irrigation and Power, Wildlife Institute of India, Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, the Gharial Conservation Alliance, Development Alternatives, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Worldwide Fund for Nature, and the divisional forest officers of the three states. The committee will plan strategies for protection of gharials and their habitat, involving further research on gharial ecology and socioeconomic evaluation of dependent riparian communities. Funding for this new initiative will be mobilized as a subscheme of the \u2018Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats\u2019 in the yearly amount of 50\u201380 million Indian rupees (US$ 1 million to 1.7 million) for five years. In captivity Gharials are bred in captivity in the National Chambal Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, and in the Gharial Breeding Centre in Nepal's Chitwan National Park, where they are generally grown for two to three years and average about one metre in length, when released.In India, they are also kept in the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, Indira Gandhi Zoological Park, Jawaharlal Nehru Biological Park in Bokaro Steel City, Bannerghatta Zoo in Bangalore, Junagadh Zoo and Biological Park Itanagar.

Dorsal surfaces become dark, almost grey-black, at about 20 years of age. Ventrals are yellowish-white. The neck is elongated and thick. The dorsals are more or less restricted to the median regions of the back. The fingers are extremely short and thickly emarginated with a web. Males develop a hollow bulbous nasal protuberance at sexual maturity.Brazaitis, P. (2001). A Guide to the Identification of the Living Species of Crocodilians.

Gharial Conservation AllianceThe elongated, narrow snout is lined by 110 sharp interdigitated teeth, and becomes proportionally shorter and thicker as an animal ages. There are 27 to 29 upper and 25 or 26 lower teeth on each side. These teeth are not received into interdental pits; the first, second, and third mandibular teeth fit into notches in the upper jaw. The front teeth are the largest. The snout is narrow and long, with a dilation at the end and its nasal bones are comparatively short and are widely separated from the pre-maxillaries. The nasal opening of a gharial is smaller than the supra-temporal fossae. The lower anterior margin of the orbit (jugal) is raised and its mandibular symphysis is extremely long, extending to the 23rd or 24th tooth. A dorsal shield is formed from four longitudinal series of juxtaposed, keeled, and bony scutes. The length of the snout is 3.5 (in adults) to 5.5 times (in young) the breadth of the snout's base. The nuchal and dorsal scutes form a single continuous shield composed of 21 or 22 transverse series. Gharials have an outer row of soft, smooth, or feebly keeled scutes in addition to the bony dorsal scutes. They also have two small postoccipital scutes. The outer toes are two-thirds webbed, while the middle toe is only one-third webbed. They have a strong crest on the outer edge of the fore arm, leg, and foot. Typically, adult gharials have a dark olive colour tone, while young ones are pale olive, with dark brown spots or cross-bands.Boulenger, G. A. (1890). The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma. Reptilia and Batrachia. London: Taylor and Francis.The well-developed, laterally flattened tail and webbed rear feet provide tremendous manoeuvrability in deepwater habitat. On land, however, an adult gharial can only push itself forward and slide on its belly. The laterally compressed tail serves both to propel the animal and as a base from which to strike at prey.The three largest examples reported were a 6.5-m gharial killed in the Gogra River of Faizabad in August 1920, a 6.3-m individual shot in the Cheko River of Jalpaiguri in 1934, and a giant of 7-m animal, which was shot in the Kosi River of northern Bihar in January 1924.

The global gharial population is estimated at fewer than 235 individuals, which are threatened by loss of riverine habitat, depletion of fish resources and use of fishing nets. As the population has declined drastically in the past 70 years, the gharial is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.The gharial is one of the longest of all living crocodilians, measuring up to 6.25 m. With 110 sharp interdigitated teeth in its long thin snout it is well adapted to catching fish, its main diet. The male has a distinctive boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as ghara. Gharials once inhabited all the major river systems of the Indian Subcontinent, from the Irrawaddy River in the east to the Indus River in the west. Their distribution is now limited to only 2% of their former range. They inhabit foremost flowing rivers with high sand banks that they use for basking and building nests. They usually mate in the cold season. The young hatch before the onset of the monsoon.The gharial is one of three crocodilians native to India, the other two being the mugger crocodile and the saltwater crocodile.Choudhury, B.C. (ed.)

Some died out at the same time as the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous, others survived until the early Eocene.

The discovery of the fossil remains of the Puerto Rican gharial Aktiogavialis puertorisensis in a cave located in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico, suggested that the Caribbean served as the link between the two continents. Gharials have sacrificed the great mechanical strength of the robust skull and jaw that most crocodiles and alligators have, and consequently are unable to prey on larger creatures. The reduced weight and water resistance of their lighter skull and very narrow jaw enables gharials to catch rapidly moving fish, using a side-to-side snapping motion. At their peak, the Gavialoidea were numerous and diverse; they occupied much of Asia and America up until the Pliocene. One species, Rhamphosuchus crassidens of India, is believed to have grown to an enormous 15 metres (~50 feet) or more."}]}

This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are not tolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.Alligators play an important role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. Alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. Alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly nutria, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation.Keddy, P.A., L.

They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. Alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, American alligators can and will climb trees to bask in if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the alligators will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.(published online January 25, 2014) Hunting and dietThe American alligator is considered an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most alligators will eat a wide variety of animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the alligator. However, most animals captured by alligators are considerably smaller than the alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons are some of the most commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced nutria are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult alligators, although only larger adult alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, and waterfowl, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults.Fish and other aquatic prey taken in the water or at the water's edge form the major part of alligator's diet and may be eaten at any time of the day or night. Adult alligators also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50\u00a0m (170\u00a0ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, alligators may also ambush them from the edge of the water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids). The alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone.WEC203/UW230: Living with Alligators: A Florida Reality. Edis.ifas.ufl.edu. Retrieved on 2012-08-21.Alligators often eat prey that would seem unusual for a crocodilian. Alligators rarely prey on adult deer, but will do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, alligators have been observed killing and eating bobcats, but such events are uncommon and have little effect on bobcat populations. Alligator predation on Florida panthers is rare, but has been documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther.Sivlerstein, Alvin (1997). The Florida Panther. Brooksville, Connecticut: Millbrook Press. pp. 41+. ISBN 0-7613-0049-X. Alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded, although it is unknown if the bears taken were adults, as adult bears are powerful enough to successfully fend off an alligator attack. Although alligators have been listed as predators of manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation, even on calves.Whitaker, John O. (1996). The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals. New York, pg. 808. ISBN 9-780679-446316.In 2013, alligators and other crocodilians were reported to also eat fruit. Such behavior has been witnessed, as well as documented from stomach contents, with the alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the alligator diet further reveals that alligators may be responsible for spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Tool useAmerican alligators have been documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means they are among the first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials. Vocalizations Crocodilians are the most vocal of all reptiles and have a variety of different calls depending on the age, size, and sex of the animal. The American alligator can perform specific vocalizations to declare territory, signal distress, threaten competitors, and locate suitable mates. Juvenile alligators can perform a high-pitched hatchling call (a \"yelping\" trait common to many crocodilian species' hatchling young) to alert their mothers when they are ready to emerge from the nest. Juveniles also make a distress call to alert their mothers if they are being threatened. Although alligators have no vocal cords, both males and females bellow loudly to attract mates and declare territory by sucking air into their lungs and blowing it out in intermittent, deep-toned roars. The bellowing of the American alligator is distinct from the loud roaring of most crocodilians, and is considered unique. Male alligators are known to use infrasound during mating bellows. Bellowing is performed in a \"head oblique, tail arched\" posture. Infrasonic waves from a bellowing male alligator can cause the surface of the water directly over and to either side of its back to literally \"sprinkle\" in what is commonly called the \"water dance\". Large bellowing \"choruses\" of alligators during the breeding season are commonly initiated by females and perpetuated by males. Observers of large bellowing choruses have noted they are often felt more than they are heard due to the intense infrasound emitted by males. Alligators bellow in B flat, and bellowing choruses can be induced by tuba players, sonic booms, and large aircraft. In addition to bellowing, alligators can growl, hiss, or cough to threaten others and declare territory. ReproductionThe breeding season begins in the spring. On spring nights, alligators gather in large numbers for group courtship, the so-called \"alligator dances\". The female builds a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. After she lays her 20 to 50 white eggs, about the size of a goose egg, she covers them with more vegetation, which heats as it decays, helping to keep the eggs warm. This differs from Nile crocodiles, which lay their eggs in pits. The temperature at which alligator eggs develop determines their sex (see temperature-dependent sex determination). Those eggs which are hatched at a temperature of 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F) or more become males, while those at a temperature of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) or lower become female. The nests built on levees are warmer and thus produce males, while the cooler nests of wet marsh produce females. The female remains near the nest throughout the 65-day incubation period, protecting it from intruders. When the young begin to hatch, the mother quickly digs them out and carries them to the water in her mouth, as some other crocodilian species are known to do. The young are tiny replicas of adult alligators with a series of yellow bands around their bodies that serve as camouflage. Hatchlings gather into pods and are guarded by their mother and keep in contact with her through vocalizations. Young alligators eat small fish, frogs, crayfish, and insects. They are preyed on by large fish, birds, raccoons, and adult alligators. Mother alligators eventually become more aggressive towards their young, which encourages them to disperse. Young alligators grow 3 \u2013 a year and reach adulthood at 6 ft. An alligator can live up to 50 years. Interactions with exotic speciesNutria were introduced into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana has had a bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large alligators that are the most important in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.Recently, a population of non-native Burmese pythons has become established in Everglades National Park. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on alligators and vice versa have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on alligator populations.Gator-guzzling python comes to messy end.

They are found in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. They inhabit swamps, streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. Females and juveniles are also found in Carolina Bays and other seasonal wetlands. While they prefer fresh water, alligators may sometimes enter brackish water, but they are less tolerant of salt water than crocodiles, as the salt glands on their tongues do not function. One study of alligators in north-central Florida found the males preferred open lake water during the spring, while females used both swampy and open water areas. During summer, males still preferred open water, while females remained the swamps to construct their nests and lay their eggs. Both sexes may den underneath banks or clumps of trees during the winter.American alligators are less vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike a crocodile, which would instantly succumb to the cold and drown in water of 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7.2\u00a0\u00b0C), an alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness is thought to be the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to deal with cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, alligators stick their snouts though the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice."}, {"description": "Historically, hunting and habitat loss have decimated alligator populations throughout their range, and whether the species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it was believed to be in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state wildlife agencies in the South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas where it had been depleted. States began monitoring their alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as alligators during trafficking."}, {"description": "Wild alligators vary from long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in factors such as growth rate, diet, and climate. Alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, the edges of the upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number from 74\u201380. Dorsally, adult alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.Some alligators are missing an inhibited gene for melanin, which makes them albino. These alligators are extremely rare and almost impossible to find in the wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators. SizeThe American alligator is a fairly large species of crocodilian. As with all crocodilians, and as opposed to many mammals where size eventually dimishes with old age, healthy alligators continue to expand throughout their lives and the oldest specimens are the largest. Very old, large male alligators reach an expected maximum size of up to 4.6 m in length, weighing up to 453 kg, while females reach a maximum of 3 m.[1]. Animals.nationalgeographic.com[2].

Checkmark Books (1989), ISBN 978-0816021741. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching 5 to have been reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at 5.8 m in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate. If the size of this animal were correct, it would have weighed around 1000 kg. The largest alligator shot in Florida was 5.31 m, as reported by the Everglades National Park.[3]. Everglades.national-park.com[4]. FloridaAdventuring.comHowever, American alligators do not normally reach such extreme sizes. In mature males, size averages around 3.4 m in length, weighing slightly in excess of 227 kg, while in smaller females, the mature size averages 2.6 m, weighing slightly more than 91 kg. While noticeably sexual dimorphic in size, the sexual dimorphism of this species is relatively modest amongst crocodilians.Saalfeld, D. T., Webb, K. K., Conway, W. C., Calkins, G. E., & Duguay, J. P.

Given that female alligators have relatively higher survival rates at an early age and a large percentage of given populations are comprised by immature or young breeding alligators, relatively few large mature males of the expected length of 3.4 m or more are typically seen.Lance, V. A., Elsey, R. M., & Lang, J. W. (2000). Sex ratios of American alligators (Crocodylidae): male or female biased? Journal of Zoology, 252(1), 71-78. Weight varies considerably depending on length, age, health, season and available food sources. Similar to many other reptiles than range expansively into temperate zones, American alligators from the northern end of their range, such as southern Arkansas, Alabama, and northern North Carolina, tend to reach smaller sizes. The largest alligator caught in Alabama was 4.5 m in length, weighing 459 kg. In Arkansas a man killed an alligator that was 4.03 m and 626 kg. PhysiologyWhen on land, an alligator moves either by sprawling or walking, the latter involving the reptile lifting its belly off the ground. The sprawling of alligators and other crocodilians is not similar to the sprawling of salamanders and lizards, being similar to walking. Therefore, the two forms of territorial locomotion can be termed the \"low walk\" and the \"high walk\". Unlike most other land vertebrates, alligators increase their speed through the distal rather than proximal ends of their limbs. In the water, alligators swim like fish; moving their pelvic regions and tails from side to side. American alligators held the record as having the strongest laboratory-measured bite of any living animal, measured at up to 9452 N. It should be noted that this experiment had not been, at the time of the paper published, replicated in any other crocodilians, and the same laboratory was able to measure a greater bite force in saltwater crocodiles;[5] notwithstanding this very high biting force, the muscles opening the alligator's jaw are quite weak, and the jaws can be held closed by hand or tape when an alligator is captured. During respiration, air flow is unidirectional, looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation; the alligator's abdominal muscles can alter the position of the lungs within the torso, thus shifting the center of buoyancy, which allows the alligator to dive, rise, and roll within the water."}, {"description": "The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), sometimes referred to colloquially as a gator or common alligator, is a large crocodilian reptile endemic to the southeastern United States. It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae; it is larger than the other extant alligator species, the Chinese alligator. Adult male American alligators measure up to 3.4 to in length, and can weigh up to 453 kg. Females are smaller, measuring around 3 m. The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to North Carolina. It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical climates.Alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year. The American alligator is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting has decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed from the list in 1987. Alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi."}, {"description": "The American alligator was first classified by French zoologist Fran\u00e7ois Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator;url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=174366# the American alligator shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped in the family Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are more closely related to the American alligator than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial.Members of this superfamily first arose in the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and other cold-blooded vertebrates."}, {"description": "Attacks on humansAlligators are capable of killing humans, but are generally wary enough not to see them as a source of potential prey. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. Alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity.Crocodile and Alligator Differences \u2013 Animal Facts for Kids. Sciencekids.co.nz (2012-07-11). Retrieved on 2012-08-21. Alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.As human populations increase, and as they build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, incidents are inevitable where alligators invade, or at least appear to invade, human life. Since 1948, 275 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which at least 17 resulted in death.Living with Alligators, Myfwc.com. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the US throughout the 1970s\u20131990s, but alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, alligators killed three Floridians in less than a week. Alligator wrestling Since the late 1880s, alligator wrestling has been a source of entertainment for some. Created by the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes prior to the arrival of Europeans, this tourism tradition continues to persist despite criticism from animal rights activists. Alligator farming Today, alligator farming is a large, growing industry in Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. These states produce a combined annual total of some 45,000 alligator hides. Alligator hides bring good prices and hides in the 6 to 7-ft range have sold for $300 each. The market for alligator meat is growing, and about 300000 lb of meat are produced annually. According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, raw alligator meat contains roughly 200 Calories (840 kJ) per 3-oz (85-g) serving, of which 27 Calories (130 kJ) come from fat. SymbolThe American alligator is the official state reptile of Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Several organizations and products from Florida have been named after the animal.\"Gators\" has been the nickname of the University of Florida's sports teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on a shipment of the school's football pennants. The mascot stuck, perhaps because the team captain's nickname was Gator.The Gator Bowl is a college football game held in Jacksonville annually since 1946, with Gator Bowl Stadium hosting the event until the 1993 edition. The Gatornationals is a NHRA drag race held at the Gainesville Raceway in Gainesville since 1970."}]}

It was first described as Osteoblepharon osborni by Schmidt in 1919, based on a few specimens from the Upper Congo Basin in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Inger in a 1948 paper found the specimens wanting of characteristics that would justify a generic separation from Osteolaemus and referred the specimens to Osteolaemus osborni. Later, Wermuth and Mertens (1961), reduced it to the current subspecies rank.Recent evidence from the analysis of DNA indicates that there are three distinctly different populations of Osteolaemus that may merit full species recognition. These would be O. tetrapis, O. osborni, and a third currently unnamed species. EtymologyThe generic name Osteolaemus means \"bony throat\", and is derived from the Ancient Greek \u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd (bone) and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (throat). The genus was named as such due to the osteoderms found among the scales in the neck and belly.The specific epithet tetraspis means \"four shields\", and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (four) and \u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (shield), as the back of the neck has four large shield-like scales."}, {"description": "Osteolaemus tetraspis@Crocodilian Species List Osteolaemus tetraspis@Crocodile Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan - Second Edition"}, {"description": "Dwarf crocodiles range across tropical lowland regions of sub-Saharan West Africa and West Central Africa.

The subspecies O. t. tetraspis is found mainly in the westerly reaches of this range while O. t. osborni is restricted to the Democratic Republic of Congo's rain forest.Osteolaemus individuals reside in permanent ponds in swamps and areas of slight current of rain forest rivers, though reports exist of dwarf crocodiles in isolated pools in the savannah, where burrows are dug to aestivate during the dry season."}, {"description": "Dwarf crocodiles are a little-known species so, unlike their more studied relatives, conservationists aren't as aware of how their populations are faring under the growing human pressure over the ecosystems where they abide. Where survey data is available, it shows some degree of decline, either by hunting for bush meat or habitat loss due to deforestation. However, it is a widely spread, and presumably numerous, species so is not as endangered as other forest denizens.Though some skins are used in local manufacturing of leather products, they are of poor quality, so there is little interest in captive breeding or a sustainable use program."}, {"description": "Dwarf crocodiles attain a medium adult length of 1.5 m, though the maximum recorded length for this species is 1.9 m. Adult specimens typically weigh between 18 and, with the largest females weighing up to 40 kg and the largest males weighing 80 kg.[1][2] Adults are a uniform black on their backs and sides with a yellowish underside with black patches. Juveniles have a lighter brown banding on body and tails and yellow patterns on the head.As a result of its small size and heightened vulnerability to predation, this species of crocodile has a heavily armoured neck, back and tail and also has osteoderms on its belly and underside of neck.Osteolaemus has a blunt short snout, as long as it is wide, similar in fact to that of a dwarf caiman, probably a result of occupying a similar ecological niche. The dentition consists of 4 premaxillary teeth, 12 to 13 on the maxilla and 14 to 15 on the dentary bone.O. tetraspis has lighter colours, a more pointed, upturned snout and more body armour than O. osborni."}, {"description": "The dwarf crocodile is a slow, timid, and mainly nocturnal reptile. As with all crocodilians, it is an adept predator of vertebrates, large invertebrates such as crustaceans and, when presented with the opportunity, also eats carrion. Foraging is mainly done in or near the water, though in areas with substantial ground cover, they may expand their feeding pattern to land in extensive forays, especially following rains.The Congo Basin subspecies demonstrates seasonality in its dietary regime, feeding on fish during the wet season's floods. When faced with the scarceness of food during the dry season, individuals turn to crustaceans and food intake is generally reduced.True to its solitary, nocturnal nature, a dwarf crocodile digs out a burrow to hide in and rest during the day, which can sometimes have a submerged entrance. An individual lacking the right conditions to do so usually abides between tree roots that hang over the ponds in which it lives. ReproductionInteracting closely only in breeding season, female dwarf crocodiles build their nest mounds at the beginning of the wet season, which spans May and June. The nest, situated near the water, is a mound of wet, decaying vegetation that incubates the eggs due to the heat generated by the decomposition of the plant material. A small number of eggs are laid, numbering about 10, though in extreme cases it can go up to 20 eggs, and they incubate in 85 to 105 days. Hatchlings measure 28\u00a0cm when emerging from the eggs. The female guards the nest during the incubation period and after the eggs hatch it watches over the young for an unknown period of time as young can be eaten by a great range of predators (birds, fish, mammals and reptiles, including other crocodiles)."}, {"description": "The dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), also known as the African dwarf, broad-snouted or bony crocodile is an African crocodile.

The crocodiles do not defend their nests during incubation. From one to five days prior to hatching, the young begin to call from within the eggs. This induces and synchronizes hatching in siblings and stimulates adults to open the nest. It is not known if the adult that opens a given nest is the female which laid the eggs. As young emerge from the nest, the adult picks them up one by one in the tip of its mouth and transports them to the water. Adults may also assist young in breaking through the egg shell by chewing or manipulating the eggs in its mouth."}, {"description": "The freshwater crocodile is a relatively small crocodilian. Males can grow to 2.3 - long, while females reach a maximum size of 2.1 m. Males commonly weigh around 70 kg, with large specimens up to 100 kg or more, against the female weight of 40 kg.[1] In areas such as Lake Argyle and Katherine Gorge there exist a handful of confirmed 4 m individuals. This species is shy and has a more slender snout and have slightly smaller teeth than the dangerous saltwater crocodile. The body colour is light brown with darker bands on the body and tail\u2014these tend to be broken up near the neck. Some individuals possess distinct bands or speckling on the snout.

Rounded, pebbly scales cover the flanks and outsides of the legs."}, {"description": "Until recently, the freshwater crocodile was common in northern Australia, especially where saltwater crocodiles are absent (such as more arid inland areas and higher elevations). In recent years, the population has dropped dramatically due to the ingestion of the invasive cane toad.

The crocodiles are also infected by Griphobilharzia amoena, a parasitic trematode, in regions such as Darwin."}, {"description": "Although the freshwater crocodile does not attack humans as potential prey, it can deliver a nasty bite. There have been very few incidents where people have been bitten whilst swimming with freshwater crocodiles, and others incurred during scientific study. An attack by a freshwater crocodile on a human was recorded at Barramundi Gorge (also known as Maguk) in Kakadu National Park and resulted in minor injuries; the victim managed to swim and walk away from the attack.

However, they are still consistently found in low-level billabongs, living alongside the saltwater crocodiles near the tidal reaches of rivers.In May 2013, a freshwater crocodile was seen in a river near the desert town of Birdsville, hundreds of kilometres south of their normal range.

In the past, the false gharial was thought to have a diet similar to its relative the gharial (only fish and very small vertebrates), but new evidence and occurrences have proven, despite the false gharial's narrow snout, it has a generalist diet. In addition to fish and smaller water animals, mature adults will prey on larger vertebrates, including proboscis monkeys, long-tailed macaques, deer, water birds, and reptiles.At the end of 2008, a 4-m female false gharial attacked and ate a fisherman in central Kalimantan; his remains were found in the gharial's stomach.Rachmawan, D., Brend, S. (2009).Human-Tomistoma interactions in central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo Crocodile Specialist Group Newsletter January 2009 \u2013 March 2009. Volume 28 No. 1: 9\u201311. This was the first verified fatal human attack by a false gharial, although at least one other is suspected. ReproductionFalse gharials are mound-nesters. Females lay small clutches of 13 to 35 eggs per nest, and appear to produce the largest eggs of extant crocodilians. Sexual maturity in females appears to be attained around 2.5 to, which is large compared to other crocodilians.It is not known when they breed in the wild or when the nesting season is. Once the eggs are laid, and construction of the mound is completed, the female abandons her nest. Unlike most other crocodilians, the young receive no parental care and are at risk of being eaten by predators, such as mongooses, tigers, leopards, civets, and wild dogs. The young hatch after 90 days and are left to fend for themselves."}, {"description": "False gharials are native to Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, Sumatra, and Borneo, but were extirpated in Thailand.
